Over the next 12 games, the Sox play 9 of them against sub .500 teams. The next team in the rankings, the Jays, have a *slightly* harder schedule going 8 of 12 against sub .500 teams. The catch is that from the 17th through July 3rd, they will be playing playoff bound teams including a series in Toronto against the Sox. 

Our next goal should be to jump over them by July 3rd when we are playing against the Cubs.

1,littleike0,"Hi all,

I have 2 tickets to the game this Saturday, September 25th at 4:05PM that I am unable to use due to some last minute plans. The tickets are in loge box 102, row EE. Face value with fees is $400 - looking for the cost of the tickets themselves without fees, so would be $376 for the pair. Similar seats on Stubhub and the like are going for $100-150 more, so a decent savings if you're looking to go to the game.

1,ASH3N_,"Hey Sox Fans,

Australian here, I love all American sports, and have been a Red Sox fan since 2014. With Covid hopefully starting to settle down in the near future and me sitting here on a Thursday morning in my Sale jersey watching him hopefully get another win, I convinced my wife we need to make a sports trip to the US and see all our teams in their home stadiums.

Anyway, long story short. I am trying to get an idea of how much it will cost to have a full Fenway experience and instead of scouring the internet getting dubious answers, I am hoping I can get a better idea from the real fans. 

So tl;dr
If you could do the full Fenway/Boston experience over a couple of days in the city, how much would it cost for tickets to the game and to do any other ""must-sees"" in Bean Town. Any help would be awesome.",1632362335,False,False,2,Trip to Fenway,1.0,12,815,155
