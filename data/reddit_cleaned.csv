For cards involving players, I think the runaway winner is Cal Ripken’s 2131st consecutive game in 1995. This moment happened right as the hobby was coming down from its peak but was still quite popular, and it’s also the rare historic player achievement where the exact day it would happen was known well in advance (ie. lots of preorders). It was also a record that virtually everyone was happy to see broken by the man who broke it, and Cal was very much the hero baseball needed coming off the strike.

For cards involving non-players, it would probably be President George W. Bush’s opening pitch from the 2001 World Series. The country had never been so unified in my lifetime, and Baseball had draped itself in patriotism that postseason.

Prediction - Over 8

After going 5-1 in his first seven starts, Webb (5-1, 3.82 ERA) has recorded four straight no-decisions. Webb, 25, will try to snap his team's winless streak against the Rockies. In eight career appearances (seven starts) against Colorado, he is 4-1 with a 4.47 ERA. On May 18, he gave up three runs and four hits over seven innings in a no-decision against the Rockies at Denver. In the Giants' last four games following a win, the over is 3-0-1. As a home favorite, the Giants are 8-2-1 in their last 11 games.

The Rockies will start left-hander Austin Gomber (2-6, 6.54 ERA). In his last two starts, he's given up 17 runs and 17 hits in 6 1/3 innings, and the over is 6-0 in the Giants' last 6 home games vs. a left-handed starter. In his last five starts, the 28-year-old is 0-4 with a 9.85 ERA, dating back to a loss against the Giants on May 9. Over 5 1/3 innings, he gave up five runs on five hits. In four career starts against San Francisco, Gomber is 0-4 with a 10.90 ERA. Against him, Wilmer Flores is 4-for-10 with a home run.

0,maximusprime2328,"One of the most important and overlooked parts of the game, in terms of broadcast presentation, is the relationship between the pitcher, catcher and batter. This is the game within the game. Some broadcasters do their best to describe the current pitching situation from pitch to pitch and from batter to batter. But for the common folk, who don't understand the intricacies of the game within the game, they are missing a crucial part of the game. 

I fear most people are just waiting for the ball to get hit. Missing out on this crucial, and honestly, very exciting part of the game. 

I've thought of a ton of ways to make this part more engaging. More broadcast graphics mainly. Although recently I came across some [GoPro catcher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9FsL3rDIXk) and umpire video on Youtube. Most videos at least a year old. **This type of first person umpire camera is something they should test and implement across the MLB.** Or if they had some kind of static camera directly behind or on the backstop that gives the viewer that same POV. 

I say this because it really gives you a better perspective on what the pitcher is delivering. A viewer can actually see the velocity of a fastball or the break of a slider first hand. This perspective really makes a huge different.

The camera should not go on the catcher because it could affect their game.

I also imagine they haven't implemented something like this because of delay it would create in the broadcast. It would mainly have to be used for replay (not ideal) because if you use a small camera like a GoPro, it will have wireless delay to the broadcast booth. And you can't mount a full camera on an umpire. That's why I was also some kind of mount behind the umpire (could affect passed balls) or on the backstop.

The ones I have listened to drove me nuts, I couldn't even watch the game. Most of them seem to talk way too much and a lot of times they get so far off subject they aren't even talking baseball, the high pitched voices and when they call an exciting play or homer it doesn't seem natural, it's like they are reading something pre-written.  Now, I do think that women who do the pre-game and in-game sideline interviews and reports are outstanding. I think it's probably because the coaches and athletes probably tend to be more friendly and open than they would with men, unless it's Bill Belichick, he's a grump with everyone. The Friday night games on Apple TV are especially bad. Why can't they just use the local broadcasters for the home team? I understand that traditionally women didn't call men's pro-sports but I don't recall anyone being upset about it or demanding that women be put in the booth. It seems like lately there is this huge push, almost to the point that on Friday night baseball on Apple TV there's no men at all involved with any part of the pre-game or announcing. So without the big public demand, why is this being forced on viewers? Before you decide to rip my head off, this isn't sexist. Women can do virtually any job a man can do and vice versa.  But you're being dishonest if you don't realize that there's just some things men do better than women and vice versa.

0,K-ShlashGoat,"I was taking a sports business class in which we discussed the NPB (Nippon Professional Baseball) and how they practice a form of baseball protectionism that prevents Japanese players from coming to the majors for 9 years and limit the foreign players on their rosters. Given the enourmous popularity of baseball in Japan, this is a market inefficiency the MLB is ill equipped to handle but it does mean that the quality of baseball competition in Japan is substantial and could provide a very interesting global business opportunity. In European soccer, the best teams from all the biggest leagues compete in the UEFA Champions League, which is one of the most exciting competitions in all of sports. 

Baseball could use a similar competition. It'd be great to have Mexican, Carribean, Korean, and Taiwanese professional teams as well but I'm not sure if the competition would be at all comparable to MLB and NPB. 

Perhaps NPB should instead expand into the Korean and Taiwanese markets or create a regional competition with the best teams from those respective countries and the NPB. 

However, the NPB has proven to be both in terms of fan interest and player quality, at least some what comparable to MLB baseball. I propose creating a new competition between the Best MLB and NPB team each year. I think doing a home and home style series would be too difficult travel wise though it would be cool to see them in eachothers respective ballparks. Instead a neutral site of Honolulu, Hawaii in a repurposed (and likely rebuilt) Aloha stadium is the perfect location for such an event. It'd probably be a best of 7 series to be similar to both the Japan and World Series

I think late February after the Super Bowl, in what is considered a sports doldrums. This allows it to not conflict with Spring Training and March Madness and in Hawaii, weather is not an obstacle(though it does rain some in Hawaii in February). Hawaii is also a bit tourist destination for Japanese people so the event could be well travelled. 

What do you think? Would such an event be smart to engage fan interest and increase engagement with the Japanese market?",1652615822,False,False,1,"Baseball needs a ""Champions League-esque"" competition between the World Series Champion and Japan Series Champion",1.0,0,2143,367

0,hoyas1,"Went to Guaranteed Rate Field today for White Sox/Angels and it was my first time at the ballpark. I'm not a Sox fan/from Chicago, but had some down time on my weekend trip and figured I'd cross the park off my list. 

I've been to a healthy amount of parks, but I don't think I've ever actually thought about/judged/considered the game day experience before, which I guess is telling. Some examples of what I saw that have stuck with me:

1. There were like 5 entrances into the stadium. That's it. This can't be normal, right? I showed up 40 mins before first pitch and figured I'd have plenty of time to walk around, but between the 5 entrances and a giveaway today that I didn't know about, I didn't get into the park until AFTER Trout homered in the first.

2. You only get access to the level where your seats are. This was wild. I bought upper level seats for $9 + fees and figured I'd just walk around the main concourse, grab food then head to my seats. But when I got into the park, there were ushers checking tickets once to get in and AGAIN to enter the concourse! Apparently my ticket in the upper level ONLY gave me access to the upper level. I mean, between innings the Sox broadcast food options in the lower level that only people with tickets on that level had access to! Wild

3. Entrance/exits. I mentioned the 5 entrances coming in, but this issue also popped up again when exiting. The escalators going up were never switched to going down, so the only way to exit was the stairs or the ramps that make the trip down take forever. 

I realize this may sound like a whiny post which isn't my intent, since all things considered I thought the park was nice and the train dropping you off across the street was remarkably convenient. But I'm wondering, are there any other parks that have quirks/features that don't make sense, or am I right that some of these were just super weird?",1651460977,False,False,1,Best/worst MLB ballpark GameDay experience?,1.0,0,1902,349

A couple displays were showing highlights of historic moments in baseball. Explaining these to my daughter, I found it hard to describe why they were so important. I realized it was missing the context, the why’s, the buildups. 

A couple examples:

Cal Ripken’s iron man record. Sure, it was a tremendous feat, but my daughter wasn’t getting the same chills as I did watching him take his victory lap. But she wasn’t around when MLB decided to cancel the World Series because of a labor dispute. Baseball needed a magical moment that year to get fans to fall in love again, and that night, they delivered. 

Jose Bautista’s bat flip. Watching that move in a vacuum is meh. He hit a home run. Big deal. If that was mid-May in a blowout game, I would even be disgusted by that kind of attitude. But it’s completely different when you remember it was a contentious playoff game where every run is important. It was in a heated battle, following a lengthy inning of debatable calls. Joey Bats needed to assert himself, and that home run left no doubt who was winning that game.

0,hugenbafan,"Hey guys,

I’ve been following the MLB for about 9 years now but I want to be more invested and really know what I’m talking about, and have a team to root for. I was hoping you guys could provide some help because there are obviously players and teams I don’t know much about. I’m not that much of a casual fan so I do know a decent amount, but I could use your guys’ help. For context, I’m a Timberwolves fan (NBA) and a Saints fan (NFL). This might not make too much sense at first, but I have reasoning for it. I enjoy watching teams that have good uniforms, young-ish players that are exciting and trying to win, and organizations that are somewhat stable. The Timberwolves have been bad for a long time but they have a fun young talent (Anthony Edwards), some other really good players (DLo and KAT), a team full of defenders/toughness (Pat Bev, Vanderbilt), a good new coach (Chris Finch), and an organization that is developing a winning direction with A-Rod and Lore. Similarly, the Saints have Michael Thomas, Marshon Lattimore, Ceedy Duce, Mickey Loomis as the GM, etc. These are the types of teams I enjoy and it would be great if you guys could find teams with similar identities in the MLB. Thank you and I really appreciate it!

Teams I am considering:
White Sox
Mariners
Marlins
Cardinals

MLBPA and MLB owners/Manfred clashed earlier this year, undoubtedly with tensions still there.

Initially, the players struck me as selfish- “You make millions, stop being greedy”

Through cognitive dissonance, I couldn’t side with them completely.

After some thinking, I realized that players and fans need a symbiotic relationship separate of owners.

Step one is to get greed and money out of the owners hands and into the hands of the players. As if we think players already get paid an absurdly abnormal amount of money, just wait until that owner money gets in their pockets. 

Step two would be to recognize this astronomical money as fans, which has been kept lowkey by owners, as a ridiculous amount of money for anyone (including players). Especially considering what fans have to pay for decent tickets, concessions, parking, and the current state of America’s economy.

Step three as fans is to realize that money is not only generated by players, but by fans, and that similar to owners vs players, fans are receiving a disproportionate dividend. 

So in my anecdotal conclusion, we all should prioritize getting big money out of ownership, they don’t do any of the glove work. Let players assume this money as theirs and then eventually demand fairer prices for fans and increase in pay for concession workers, and team personnel.",1648834013,False,False,1,Anecdote: Players vs Owners,1.0,0,1386,222

I also see plenty of the same arguments of “why can the hitters not just hit oppo” or bunt it down the opposite line. If this is a played out argument forgive me,but are we ignoring that in shift situations, the pitchers are throwing into the shift. Do you know how hard it is to inside-out a hard inside pitch. Nearly impossible. You get 90+ on the inside part of the plate, professional or not, your only option is to pull the ball into the shift.

0,gRacexMercy,"  I'm 61 and been a baseball fan since 1968.  For the first time I'm considering to just be done with MLB. I was looking so forward to the 2022 season it felt like the next era was just beginning for the game. In the end though it is just a game. 

  As a family and mostly Cubs fans we returned to attending ballgames last year after a four year absence due to ticket prices. Last year in groups of 7 to 15 we attended five games in Cincy and Chicago.  Parts of us attended an additional 12 games in Cincy, Chicago, St. Louis and Atlanta, (there is a Braves fan in the family).  Tickets, food, souvenirs, restaurants, gas, airline tickets and motel rooms were purchased. That's a lot of hard earned cash for a middle class extended family to spend and we'll we were looking forward to expanding on that this year. With our April 2nd outing now unlikely and time pressing our scheduled family outings we've now decided to explore and commit to other options.  We surely can't be the only ones. 

  It's very sad but I'm afraid this is a new era alright. The beginning of the end for our national pastime. I mean they've already really have pretty much excluded middle class families from their fanbase by the expense of attending ballgames. Not to mention already having excluded the lower middle class and below previously. I'm disgusted and disappointed MLB and MLBPA.

Montreal and Charlotte

Why Montreal? Given the fact that Montreal had the Expos ripped away from them and given to Washington of all places, damn it the city of Montreal loved their Expos. They were and still are passionate about the game of baseball. But also the city has a rich history not just with the Expos but with the game of baseball in general. Plus Montreal is a pretty sports hungry city having the Alouettes and the Canadiens. So it isn't like they can't support an MLB team if one is put back there. They have the money.


 Charlotte because of the fact that they too have a pretty die hard sports city having the Hornets there but also the state in general have the Hurricanes in the NHL and the Panthers in the NFL.

After the Oakland Athletics and Tampa Bay Rays get new ballparks, I believe that these 2 cities have the most serious plans for expansion:

Nashville Stars - (Music City Baseball Group ownership)  
[https://www.mlbmusiccity.com/](https://www.mlbmusiccity.com/)

Portland Pioneers - (Portland Diamond Project Group ownership)  
[https://portlanddiamondproject.com/](https://portlanddiamondproject.com/)

&amp;#x200B;

**MY NEW REALIGNMENT FOR 2028:**

With 32 teams, there would be 8 4-team divisions in realignment. The Rays and Rockies would swap leagues to make the geography better.

&amp;#x200B;

**AMERICAN LEAGUE**

|**AL EAST**|**AL NORTH**|**AL SOUTH**|**AL WEST**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Baltimore Orioles|Chicago White Sox|Colorado Rockies|Los Angeles Angels|
|Boston Red Sox|Cleveland Guardians|Houston Astros|Oakland Athletics|
|New York Yankees|Detroit Tigers|Kansas City Royals|Portland Pioneers|
|Toronto Blue Jays|Minnesota Twins|Texas Rangers|Seattle Mariners|

&amp;#x200B;

**NATIONAL LEAGUE**

|**NL EAST**|**NL NORTH**|**NL SOUTH**|**NL WEST**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|New York Mets|Chicago Cubs|Atlanta Braves|Arizona D' backs|
|Philadelphia Phillies|Cincinnati Reds|Miami Marlins|Los Angeles Dodgers|
|Pittsburgh Pirates|Milwaukee Brewers|Nashville Stars|San Diego Padres|
|Washington Nationals|St. Louis Cardinals|Tampa Bay Rays|San Francisco Giants|

&amp;#x200B;

**THE NEW REGULAR SEASON SCHEDULE FORMULA (154 Games Per Team):**

&amp;#x200B;

**Divisional Play:**

18 games each vs. all 3 division opponents = 54 games

(Three 3-Game Series Home and Three 3-Game Series Away vs. each team)

&amp;#x200B;

**Non Divisional Play Within League:**

6 games each vs. all 12 non-division opponents within league = 72 games

(One 3-Game Series Home and One 3-Game Series Away vs. each team)

&amp;#x200B;

**Interleague Play:**

6 games each vs. all 4 interleague opponents from 1 assigned interleague division = 24 games

(One 3-Game Series Home and One 3-Game Series Away vs. each team)

Assigned interleague divisions will rotate annually (4-year cycle). All 4 teams in a division would be assigned the same interleague division.

&amp;#x200B;

4 games vs. interleague ""natural"" rival = 4 games

(One 2-Game Series Home and One 2-Game Series Away)

Would be played on Thursday-Sunday directly after the All-Star break in Mid-July. Thursday and Friday at one ballpark and then Saturday and Sunday at the opposite ballpark.

(Mets-Yankees, Cubs-White Sox, Angels-Dodgers, Athletics-Giants, Orioles-Nationals, etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

**54 games + 72 games + 24 games + 4 games = 154-game regular season**

&amp;#x200B;

**THE EXPANDED POSTSEASON (12 Total Teams Qualifying):**

In my new postseason format, 12 teams (6 in each league) would qualify for the postseason.

In each league, the 4 division winners plus 2 wild cards would qualify for the postseason.

The 4 division winners would be seeded #1-#4 by record. The 2 wild-cards would be seeded #5 and #6 by record.

&amp;#x200B;

**League Wild card Series (ALWCS &amp; NLWCS):**

(#3 Seed vs. #6 Seed) and (#4 Seed vs. #5 Seed)

The #1 and #2 seeds would have a bye for this round.

Best-of-3 Series. All games in series would be hosted by the #3 and #4 seeds (division winners) regardless of regular season records and played on 3 consecutive days (Monday-Wednesday) right after the end of the regular season. The #5 and #6 seeds (wild-cards) would get no home games for this round.

&amp;#x200B;

**League Divisional Series (ALDS &amp; NLDS):**

(#1 Seed vs. wild card round winner with worst regular season record)

(#2 Seed vs. other wild card round winner)

Best of 5 Series (2-2-1 format).

&amp;#x200B;

**League Championship Series (ALCS &amp; NLCS):**

As normal. Best of 7 Series (2-3-2 format).

&amp;#x200B;

**World Series (WS):**

Memorable moments: Drysdale took home the Cy Young Award in 1962 when he won 25 games, at a time when there was only one Award given in the major leagues. In 1968, he pitched 58.2 straight scoreless innings, a record that would stand for 20 years. Included in that stretch of consecutive scoreless innings was a record six straight shutouts.

Unfortunately he got beat around twice, losing both decisions 12-2 and 7-0. Earlier in the season he started the suspended game and a regularly scheduled game in Chicago beating Cleveland twice.

Steroids are a drug that could potentially harm people in different ways, and could also harm their families as well. Allowing it will cause players to abuse it and could spread to college and high school baseball too.

Players who don’t want to use steroids would be in a significant disadvantage for having the right moral. Baseball is more than just hitting HRs, and besides this past decade the league has recorded total HR records multiple times. I love Ichiro and Ohtani who found creative ways to succeed in the sport. Coincidentally they’re both Japanese players and no Japanese player has been caught for steroids because they know it’s morally right not to use steroids. 

I want the players to be healthy and don’t feel forced to take steroids just to stay in the league. I like singles and having runners on base. I don’t want games to be decided on which team hits more dingers.

And same case for HoF. You can choose to take steroids secretly but once you’re caught you’re not in the HoF, simple.

Things we think of as being rare like perfect games and hitting for the cycle really aren't all that rare.  For that matter, even record events like 20 strikeouts aren't all that rare (20 Ks happened twice in one season, even).  And setting the Iron Man record isn't even such an event, because Lou Gehrig set the record 83 years ago and Cal Ripken beat it in 1995, only 63 years later, well within a human lifespan.  So too the single-season home run record was set in 1927, beaten in 1961, again then twice in the '90s-'00s.

I'm sure there have to be some rare things that we'd only expect to see about once in 80 years in MLB.  Any idea of what they could be?

About the only thing I can think of is Johnny Van Der Meer's two consecutive no-hitters in 1938.  Dave Stieb almost did it in 1988, but lost both (one which was perfect to that point, the other a mere no-hitter) with two outs in the ninth inning.

It was remarkable that the Red Sox were even still playing, given they had trailed, 3-0, in the series. Schilling underwent an almost barbaric procedure in which his loose tendon was sutured back into place. By the early innings, he had blood pouring through his sock -- yet he was able to fire seven brilliant frames of one-run ball against the Yankees in a 4-2 conquest and force the series to Game 7 -- which the Sox won, of course.

We are NOW at nearly 50 signatures in this journey to MAKE OUR VOICES heard to MLB players and owners currently negotiating a 2022 CBA suggested to include a UNIVERSAL Designated Hitter rule.

Personally, as a lifelong fan of this game, this truly disheartens me!  How could we be at this place in time where WITHOUT fan input, the powers that be in Major League Baseball are right now deciding the fate of the UNIVERSAL Designated Hitter behind closed doors?

I donno.  But, what I DO KNOW is that I'm NOT gonna go down with the bat on my shoulder!

0,HabsBlow,"Alright so I've had some time to mull over the whole affair, and would like to hear some thoughts on how I've viewed the whole situation. This is gonna be a bit of a read, so buckle up if you want. TLDR is at the bottom. Let's get after it boys.

This post is gonna address three major talking points: The Hall of Fame's apparent lack of consistency around steroid use; why Bonds was not elected; why Ortiz was elected. This is from a Bluejays fan. I've despised Ortiz since I was 5 years old. Take from that what you will.

HoF and Bud Selig:

The hall has appeared inconsistent about their view on steroids. It appears as though they wish to treat steroid use similar to gambling. If you do it, you won't be welcomed in Cooperstown. With that being said, you might well wonder wtf is Bud Selig doing in the Hall of fame then? Only 5 commisioners are. Why would a guy who actively downplayed steroid use be allowed in?

The Mitchel Report was done at the request of Bud Selig. He asked congress to independently look into steroid use. I think this is the Hall's justification on overlooking the steroid scandal in light of everything else he did. He brought baseball back in a time when the MLB was facing serious financial issues. He turned it into a money printing machine. 

Should that absolve him of the years of indifference towards the issue of steroid use? The Hall says yes. I think they are justified in their decision. Other commisioners could have easily continued to sweep it under the rug, or conduct their own sham investigations instead of having a third party (congress) do it. Despite the fact he ignored it, he was ultimately the reason steroid use is now treated the way it is. 

Barry Bonds:

Barry Bonds stained what is arguably the most sacred record in baseball. Achieving the home run record was something that brought world wide fame. Hank Aaron and Babe Ruth are very much symbols of America across the globe. Bonds tainted that record.

Not only did he juice, he [denied it repeatedly](https://www.espn.com/mlb/news/story?id=3113127). He knew what he was doing was wrong. He is the son of a a former big leaguer. 

He has no place in the Hall and no place in baseball. If Pete Rose set the all time hit record and he's not allowed in, Bonds shouldn't be either. I think this actually reflects well on the Hall.

David Ortiz:

He deserves to be in the Hall. Being a Hall of Fame athlete means being more than a great ball player. It means upholding a high level of ethical standards on the diamond, and off of it.

Ortiz was the face of Boston my entire childhood. He was the guy who took the mic after the bombing and said ""this is our f***ing city"". He was a key part of breaking the curse of the Great Bambino.

It also appears that [while he tested positive, he didn't know that he was using a banned substance](https://www.espn.com/mlb/news/story?id=4385699). Not to mention he willingly gave his urine to be tested.

The 1966 was possibly Sandy Koufax’s best season, but also his last. Roberto Clemente won his only MVP, as Willie Mays and Hank Aaron finished behind him. It was also the only time in MLB history two brothers both finished top ten in MVP voting. 

The voting went 1) Clemente 2) Koufax 3) Mays 4) Allen 5) Felipe Alou 6) Merichal 7) Regan 8) Aaron 9) Matty Alou 10) Rose.

Roberto Clemente .317/.360/.536 29 HR, 119 RBI, 105 R, 71 XBH

* For the first time in Clemente’s career he broke 100 RBIs in a season, and with the most notable reason being his situational hitting. Clemente led the league with a .400 AVG, .703 SLG and 1.164 OPS (in 204 PA) with RISP. He even kept his AVG at .400 and improved his OPS to 1.195 with two-out and RISP in 65 ABs. Much of Clemente’s value was in the field, as he led NL outfielders by throwing out 17 runners. Clemente finished second in the NL in total bases, extra-base hits and RBIs. The Pirates finished the year in third place, but won 92 games. Clemente’s 29 home runs would be the most he ever hit in a season. 

Sandy Koufax 1.73 ERA, 27-9, 323.0 IP, 317 K

* After winning the 1963 NL MVP and finishing runner-up in 1965, Koufax again finished runner-up in 1966 despite having the most first place votes. Koufax's 317 strikeouts were the fifth most in history, and he became the first pitcher in history to reach 300 strikeouts three different times. Koufax’s 1.73 ERA was the sixth lowest in the Live Ball Era (1920-present). The Dodgers pitching staff gave up only 490 runs in 1966, which was the lowest since World War II and the fifth least in the Live Ball Era (seventh least today). The 95 wins Dodgers clinched the NL by only two games over their rival San Francisco Giants, and without Koufax it's hard to see them doing so as Los Angeles went 29-12 when he pitched and 66-55 in all other games. Koufax led the league in ERA, IP, K, and Wins. Koufax would retire after the season due to an elbow injury, and five years later at age 36 would become the youngest Hall of Famer ever. 

Willie Mays .288/.368/.556 37 HR, 103 RBI, 99 R

* Mays won the 1954 and 1965 NL MVP -- making the largest gap in MLB history between winning the award again. Although just about every NL MVP in the gap years are scrutinized today for Mays not winning the award. The Giants finished two games behind the Dodgers for the NL pennant, which was the exact same scenario the previous season. In 1966 Mays finished third in home runs, fourth in RBIs, fifth in total bases in and sixth in OPS. Mays may not have been quite the player he once was, but he was still among the NL leaders in every statistic. Mays had a .351 AVG with RISP and that rose to .381 with two-out. A highlight included Mays hitting his 512th home run May 4th, setting the all-time National League record, and by the season’s end had the second most in all of baseball history. 

Dick Allen .317/.396/.632 40 HR, 110 RBI, 112 R, 331 TB, 75 XBH

* Allen had a huge offensive season in 1966, leading the league in OPS, slugging and extra-base hits. Allen also finished third in RBIs and OBP while fourth in AVG. He also contributed by hitting .351 with a 1.140 OPS with RISP and those rose to .368 and 1.194 with two-out and RISP. Allen’s season could have been even more productive, but in late April he dislocated his right shoulder and missed three weeks. After returning, Allen moved to left field to hide his throwing arm which would be less effective the rest of his career. He moved back to third base in July, but spent the 1966 season as a defensive liability.

Hank Aaron .279/.356/.539 44 HR, 127 RBI, 117 R, 325 TB

* Aaron led the league in both home runs and RBIs and finished second in runs scored. As the Braves relocated and played their first season in Atlanta many criticized their new ballpark Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium for being so hitter friendly due to the dimensions and the heat in Atlanta. This resulted in the ballpark quickly getting the nickname ‘The Launching Pad.’ The Braves scored a league leading 782 runs and 207 home runs -- which were the eighth most in baseball history. While Aaron’s still drove in runs and homered at a league best, his other numbers were not up to his usual high standard. Aaron’s OPS was its lowest since his rookie season, and he set a career low in batting average. 

Felipe Alou .327/.361/.533 31 HR, 74 RBI, 122 R, 218 H, 69 XBH, 355 TB

* Alou had the best season of his 17 year career in 1966, leading the NL in runs, hits and total bases. Alou along with Hank Aaron was part of a Braves team that moved to Atlanta and was criticized for their offensive output being enhanced because of their hitter's park. Yet even on a team with future cooperstown inductees Aaron and Eddie Matthews, Alou was their leading MVP finisher. Although Alou finished second in the batting title, his brother Matty won it by hitting .342 in Pittsburg. Matty also finished ninth in MVP voting. This is the only time in MLB history where two siblings finished first and second in hitting or both top ten in MVP voting.

0,Arctic_Summer,"Justin Morneau .321/.375/.559 34 HR, 130 RBI

* After a June 7th loss the Twins fell to 25-33 and 11.5 games behind the Tigers in the AL Central. Earlier in the day Twins manager Ron Gardenhire benched his first baseman who was hitting .237, but Morneau would bounce back by hitting .362 with 23 homers and 92 RBIs over his final 104 games as the Twins went 71-33 in those starts to take the AL Central. Morneau’s 130 RBIs placed second in the AL. Funny enough, Morneau was never was in the top four hitters of the Twins lineup in 2006. 

Derek Jeter .343/.417/.483 14 HR, 97 RBI, 118 R, 214 H, 34 SB

* 2006 was the closest Derek Jeter came to winning an MVP, and it didn’t help with fans that his only runner-up finish was in one of the tightest votes ever. Jeter matched Joe Mauer at the AL batting lead at .346 with a first inning single on the final day of the season, but would go on hitless the rest of the day to finish second at .343. The Yankees led the AL with 97 wins and 930 runs scored, and Jeter provided a lot on offense. His .381 AVG with RISP ranked third in the AL and ranked sixth with a .369 AVG with two-outs and RISP. Jeter finished second in AVG and runs, third in hits, and fourth in OBP. On the basepath, Jeter's 34 stolen bases was the seventh most in the league, but he got caught only five times and his 87.1% stolen base rate was the third best. Only three other middle infielders even found themselves listed on a ten player MVP ballot by one of the 28 voters.

David Ortiz .287/.413/.636/1.049 54 HR, 137 RBI, 115 R, 119 BB

* After finishing as the AL MVP runner-up in 2005, Big Papi may have had the best season of his career in 2006. Ortiz led the league in home runs, RBIs, walks and total bases, while finishing second in both SLG and OPS. The only player to be a prominent  DH and win the MVP was Don Baylor in 1979, and that hurt Ortiz’s case. After having the division lead the entire month of July the Red Sox finished 23-34 to fall to third in the division and miss the playoffs for the first time since 2002. Yet Ortiz hit 17 home runs with a 1.127 OPS over the final two months when the Red Sox’s season fell apart.

Frank Thomas .270/.381/.545 39 HR, 114 RBI

* In his 17th MLB season, The Big Hurt spent his first outside the White Sox as he signed with the Oakland A’s. Thomas, a full-time DH now only started 135 games and never saw the field. Oakland won the division and was 79-56 with Thomas in the lineup card and 14-23 when he wasn’t. The two-time MVP finished fifth in home runs and eighth in RBIs.

Jermaine Dye .315/.385/.622/1.006 44 HR, 120 RBI, 103 R, 74 XBH, 335 TB

* The reigning World Series MVP had the best season of his career in 2006. Dye finished second in home runs, third in slugging and total bases, and fifth in OBP, RBIs, and extra-base hits. Dye was an RBI machine and hit .351 with a .716 SLG in 178 PA with RISP. The White Sox missed the playoffs but still managed to win 90 games and their offense led by Dye scored the third most runs in the league (86). 

Joe Mauer .347/.429/.507 13 HR, 84 RBI, 86 R, 79 BB

* Mauer became the first catcher in history to win the AL Batting Title and led all catchers in every offensive rate. Mauer hit .408 with a 1.200 OPS in 64 PA with two-outs and RISP.  A highlight included a five game stretch in June where he became the first player in nine years to reach base four times in five straight games. Mauer was seen as one of the better defensive catchers in baseball and helped the Twins pitching staff that gave up the second lowest run total in the AL. As the Twins won the AL Central it was unclear who their MVP was Morneau, Mauer or Johan Santana.

Johan Santana 2.77 ERA, 19-6, 0.99 WHIP, 233.2 IP, 245 K

* The Twins were second in the AL with both a 3.96 ERA and allowing 683 runs, as they’re offense ranked below league average by scoring 801 runs. Santana won his second unanimous Cy Young Award in the past three seasons -- and probably should have in 2005. Santana led the league in many categories by huge margins over there second place finishers ERA (2.77 to 3.19), WHIP (0.997 to 1.100), K (245 to 202), K/9 (9.4 to 8.4), IP (233.2 to 223.0), AVG (.216 to .241), OBP (.258 to .279), and OPS (.618 to .653). This dominance led the AL with a 7.6 bWAR, which helped the Twins win the AL Central by one game.

Travis Hafner .308/.439/.659/1.097 42 HR, 117 RBI, 100 R, 100 BB, 129 G

* The third exclusively designated hitter to finish top ten in the MVP voting Travis Hafner was arguably baseball’s best hitter in 2006. A broken hand in earlier September held Hafner to 129 games played on the season, limiting his chance to win the award. In statistical rates Hafner finished first in OBP and OPS while second in slugging. And despite his missed time Hafner finished third in home runs, four in walks and sixth in RBIs. Hafner’s six grand slams in 2006 is a single-season MLB record. 

Grady Sizemore .290/.375/.533 28 HR, 76 RBI, 134 R, 92 XBH, 22 SB, 190 H, 349 TB

* The 23 year-old centerfielder led the league in runs, doubles, and extra-base hits. While playing every game in 2006 Sizemore proved to be one of the best all-around players in the game with his defense and base-running, which led him to lead the AL with a 7.9 fWAR and finish second with a 6.7 bWAR. With Hafner’s big season and Cleveland only going 80-82 many voters put Sizemore down on their ballot.

0,Arctic_Summer,"A player’s strike in April lasted 13 days and teams missed between six and nine games. Those games were not made up, meaning teams would play a different amount across the board. But the NL would have an MVP debate led by members of their Pennant winner and their worst team. All top five finishes were in their prime and eventually went to Cooperstown.

Johnny Bench .270/.379/.541 40 HR, 125 RBI, 100 BB

* In 1970 Johnny Bench would become the first catcher to ever lead a league in home runs, and he did it again in 1972 -- the next catcher to do so would be Salvador Perez tied for the AL lead in 2021. The big Red Machine won and went 95-59 and their 707 runs scored was the second most in the NL (one run behind the Astros). Bench was one of the main reasons for the output leading the NL with 40 HR and 125 RBIs. Being the most feared power hitter in the NL, Bench walked 100 times and led the league with 23 via intentional pass. But Bench’s true value many thought was behind the plate. Many regard Bench as the best defensive catcher ever, and in 1972 he threw out 31-56 runners attempting to steal for a league-leading 56% caught stealing.

Billy Williams .333/.398/.606/1.005 37 HR, 122 RBI, 95 R, 348 TB

* Williams was the runner-up to Bench in the 1970 NL MVP, and this would repeat itself in 1972. Williams won the batting title and also led the NL in SLG, OPS, and total bases. But Williams improved with his situational hitting with a .347 AVG with a league leading .466 OBP and .719 with RISP in 163 PA. Williams made his case for the best hitter in baseball in 1972. The future Hall of Famer helped the Cubs go 85-70, but nobody else on the team came within 20 homers or 48 RBIs of Williams. No other player in baseball had the burden of carrying his team’s offense as much as Williams in 1972.

Willie Stargell .293/.373/.558 33 HR, 112 RBI

* The NL's best record belongs to the 96-59 Pittsburgh Pirates. When Stargell was in the lineup the Pirates went 84-47, but were only 12-12 when he wasn’t starting. Stargell finished in the league’s top five in home runs, RBIs, OBP and OPS. 

Joe Morgan .292/.417/.435 16 HR, 73 RBI, 122 R, 115 BB, 58 SB

* The eventual two-time MVP would break out as one of the best players in baseball during 1972 for the Big Red Machine. Morgan led the NL in runs, walks, times on-base (282) and on-base percentage. An all-around player, Morgan had the second most stolen bases in the NL and committed only eight errors at second base for a fielding rate of 99.0%. Morgan’s situational hitting helped the Reds have the second best run output in baseball, having a .427 OBP in the 117 innings he led off in while also having a .339 AVG with RISP. A highlight for Morgan was also being named all-star game MVP when he had a walk-off single.

Steve Carlton 41 GS, 27-10, 1.97 ERA, 346.1 IP, 310 K

* Before the 1972 season, the Phillies traded for Steve Carlton by sending the Cardinals Rick Wise in what turned out to be one of the biggest lopsided trades in MLB history. In 1972 Carlton won his first of four Cy Young awards, but it didn’t matter much to the franchise as they went 59-97. That means Carlton alone was the winning pitcher for the Phillies in 27 of their 59 wins, which made 46% of his team’s wins a major league record. Of winning almost half of his team’s games Carlton said “I consider that season my finest individual achievement.” The Phillies went 29-12 when Carlton started, and went 30-85 when he didn’t take the bump. Carlton also went at least nine innings in 29 starts, and threw 30 complete games. Carlton led the NL in starts, IP, ERA, CG, K, and wins.

0,Arctic_Summer,"There was a battle between Don Mattingly and Rickey Henderson for the most valuable Yankee with the debate centering over which is more valuable: scoring runs or driving them in and how much does base running and defense impact a game. George Brett had arguably his best season, while Wade Boggs in his fourth season raised his career batting average to .351. 

Don Mattingly .324/.371/.567 35 HR, 145 RBI, 107 R, 211 H, 86 XBH, 159 G

* Mattingly followed up a batting title and third place finish in the 1984 AL MVP, by winning the MVP in 1985. Mattingly led the league in RBIs, extra-base hits and total bases, finished second in hits, SLG and OPS and fourth in home runs. His ratio of 35 home runs to 41 strikeouts may have been the most impressive statistical feat by a hitter in 1985. The Yankees won 97 games, but it was not enough to make the playoffs as New York lost to Toronto on the season’s final day when they were trying to force a game 163 with them. Mattingly usually hit second or third in the lineup and created a devastating combo with leadoff hitter Rickey Henderson which helped the Yankees lead baseball with 839 runs scored.

George Brett .335/.436/.585/1.022 30 HR, 112 RBI, 103 BB, 108 R

* At age 32 the 1980 AL MVP may have had the best season of his twenty-one year hall of fame career. Brett led the Royals to 91 wins and the AL Central title by carrying their offense down the final week of the season. The Angels were leading the Royals by one game for the AL West entering the final eight games of the season, and Brett then went on a tier. Going 11 for 23 (.478 AVG) with five homers and 13 RBIs and eight extra-base hits over in his final seven games to take the division by a game. The Royals won four straight games to clinch the division -- with Brett homering in each -- and a highlight included hitting a two-run home down four runs in the sixth inning of game 161 to start a comeback rally to clinch the division. Brett’s situational hitting was exceptional hitting .340 with a .514 OBP with RISP in 218 PA, and those numbers rose to a god-like .396 AVG, .623 OBP and 1.103 OPS with two-out and RISP in 77 PA. Overall Brett led the AL in SLG and OPS, while finishing second in AVG and OBP while hitting a career-best 30 home runs and 103 walks. 

Rickey Henderson .314/.419/.516 24 HR, 146 R, 72 RBI, 80 SB, 99 BB, 143 G

* In his first season as a Yankee, Rickey led the league in runs and stolen bases, was third in OPS and fourth in AVG and OBP. His 146 runs were the most since 1950 and he became the first player since Jimmy Foxx in 1939 to score more runs than games played (nobody has done it since). Rickey set a Yankees all-time record in stolen bases and became the first 20/80 player ever as he hit 24 HR and had 80 SB. Rickey’s OBP was 48 points higher than Mattingly while his slugging was 51 points below. Rickey himself believes he lost the MVP by having a great start to the season and not finishing as well, he had a .357 AVG and .993 OPS before the all-star break, but those numbers fell to .270 and .875 in the season’s second half. His defense at center field was exceptional as total zone rating has him saving 13 runs on the year. Thus, his 9.9 bWAR and 9.7 fWAR both led the league showing his all-around game’s value.

Wade Boggs .368/.450/.478, 8 HR, 78 RBI, 107 R

* Boggs’ 758 PA was the sixth most ever in a season, and he combined that with impressive statistical rates by winning the batting title and leading the league in OBP and finishing fourth in OPS. Boggs’ 240 hits were the eleventh most in a single-season and the most since 1930, while his 340 times on-base was the eight most ever and most since 1949. The one down-side was his power with only eight homers and 53 extra-base hits. Boggs’ 187 singles would be the second most in the twenty century, as only Lloyd Warner in 1927 would have more.

The 2000 MVP was a close finish by two Giants teammates, and Barry Bonds would be the runner-up before winning four straight MVPs. Todd Helton came the closest anyone has come to hitting .400 since Ted Williams. 

Jeff Kent .334/.424/.596 33 HR, 125 RBI, 90 BB, 114 R

* The Giants cleanup hitter was put in positions to deliver with men on, as Barry Bonds would hit the spot before Kent and produce a .440 OBP with a league-leading 117 walks. With men on-base, Kent slashed .382/.482/1.114 helping Bonds score the most runs of his career. The second baseman led all NL middle infielders in homers, RBIs, OBP, BB and SLG as the Giants 925 runs still to this day ranks second in franchise history since the start of the twentieth century. Giants manager Dusty Baker chose Kent as his pick. Bonds said of Kent’s season, “The numbers he puts up for a second baseman are amazing. They're great for any player, but to do it at second base is really something.” 

Barry Bonds .306/.440/.688/1.127 49 HR, 106 RBI, 129 R, 117 BB

* Bonds was already a three-time MVP, but hadn’t won the award since 1993. His RBI total may not seem high for a player with 49 home runs, but pitchers feared Bonds adding a lot to their numbers. 73 of his league-leading 117 walks were with men on-base, giving him a .519 OBP in those moments and leaving Kent with important at-bats. Bonds was becoming more powerful than ever with a career-high in home runs and slugging. Game of Shadows would report that Bonds started using steroids after the 1998 season and with an injury-plagued season in 1999, 2000 was the first year Bonds would see the results of his new physique. 

Mike Piazza .324/.398/.614 38 HR, 113 RBI, 90 R

* Mike Piazza had his best season as a Met in his hall of fame career. He led the catches in home runs, RBIs, total bases, batting average and slugging. The Mets won 94 games and took the wild card. Piazza may have been higher on this list had he started more than 129 games. New York was far better with Piazza in the lineup going 76-53 with him, and only 18-15 without him.

Jim Edmonds .295/.411/.583 42 HR, 108 RBI, 129 R, 103 BB

* In his first year in St. Louis Edmonds set career-highs in just about every offensive category. Already known as one of the best defensive center fielders ever, Edmonds helped the Cardinals stay afloat and win the NL Central with a 96-67 record as Mark McGwire missed 73 games. 

Todd Helton .372/.563/.698/1.162 42 HR, 147 HR, 138 R, 59 2B, 103 XBH, 103 BB, 216 H

* In the middle of an August 21st game, Helton’s AVG was .400 (178 H/ 447 AB) becoming the first player since Ted Williams in 1941 to be a qualified hitter and reach the mark. Helton could have got injured or decided to sit out the rest of the season and make history. While Helton couldn’t sustain the .400 his season was impressive. The Rockies first baseman led the league in hits, doubles, RBIs and total bases. Along with 42 home runs and 103 walks. Helton’s 103 XBHs were tied for the most in a single-season since 1930. Helton became the first player since 1937 and only the fifth ever to produce a 200 hit, 40 HR, 100 RBI, 100 R, 100 XBH, 100 BB season -- and the fifth player ever joining Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Jimmy Fox and Hank Greenberg. Helton also became the seventh player to lead the league in the AVG, OBP, and SLG since World War II. But many voters held it against Helton that his numbers were inflated because he played at the mile-high Coors Field. In 1999 his teammate Larry Walker also led the league in AVG, OBP and SLG. Helton home numbers were huge in 81 games having a .391 AVG, 1.242 OPS, 27 HR, 92 R, with 88 RBIs. but his road numbers also could have kept him in the MVP race alone, having a .353 AVG, 1.071 OPS, 15 HR, and 59 RBI. Helton led the NL with a 8.9 bWAR and 8.3 fWAR. The Rockies finished 82-80, but with the best offense in the NL scoring 969 runs.

Vladimir Guerrero .345/.410/.664 44 HR, 123 RBI, 101 R, 197 H

* The 2000 Expos had the third worst record in baseball, going 67-95 but Guerrero may have been the one bright spot. His league leading 23 intentional walks proved many pitchers would rather face the rest of the Expos lineup than go up against Vlad. Still Vlad managed to set franchise records in home runs and batting average. This season is likely the best by a position player in Montreal history, as Vlad also is arguably the best player in Expos history.

Jeff Bagwell .310/.424/.615/1.039 47 HR, 132 RBI, 152 R, 107 BB

* Still to this day, Bagwell’s 152 runs scored are the most since 1936. Bagwell had a .487 OBP in the 113 innings he led off in and a .460 OBP when zero-outs. His 295 runs over a two years span (99-00) is the most in NL history. Despite the Astros scoring 938 runs, the pitching staff gave up 944 and the team finished 72-90. Bagwell had the best full season of his hall of fame career with a career-high 47 homers. 

Andrew Jones .303/.366/.541 36 HR, 104 RBI, 122 R, 199 H

* Jones was seen as the best defensive player in baseball as he roamed center field, as total zone rating had him saving 25 runs in 2000. At only twenty-three years old Jones set what would be his career-highs in runs scored, batting average, and hits. The Braves won 95 and the NL East, and Andrew was now considered the best Jones on the Braves as he outperformed the reigning MVP Chipper. 

Gary Sheffield .325/.438/.643 43 HR, 109 RBI, 105 R, 101 BB

* Sheffield had a big season at the plate in 2000, ranking third in the NL in OBP and OPS, and fourth in SLG. Sheffield also hit .357 with a 1.135 OPS with RISP. His case for the award fell as he was a well below outfield and baserunner. He committed 10 errors in left field and was caught stealing in six of ten attempts. 

Sammy Sosa .320/.406/.634 50 HR, 138 RBI, 106 R

* Although he hit 60+ home runs three times in his career, 2000 was the only season where Sosa led the league. But the Cubs had another rough season in 2000 losing 97 after losing 95 in 1999.

0,Arctic_Summer,"2003 AL MVP was probably the wildest race in baseball history. Not only was it one of the closest, but it featured TEN different players getting a first place vote -- there are only 28 votes. Alex Rodriguez won his first of three MVPs after narrowly missing out on the award numerous times.

Alex Rodriguez .298/.396/.600/.995 47 HR, 124 R, 118 RBI, 161 G

* A-Rod was probably better each of the previous three seasons. But this was still his peak A-years. Playing his final season in Texas and at shortstop (he would be traded to the Yankees), the best player in baseball centered around Bonds, Rodriguez and Pujols. But he had yet to win an MVP, while finishing second in both 1996 and 2002 (both likely should have been his) and already had arguments for winning in 1998, 2000 and 2001. Alex led the AL in HRs, Runs, and slugging. He led the AL in both bWAR (8.4) and fWAR (8.4). But only Andre Dawson in 1987 had won an MVP on a last place team before. The Rangers finished 71-91. But the real reason they finished last in the AL West was because their pitching staff finished with a 5.67 ERA, easily the worst in all of baseball. Texas’ pitching staff performed so poorly that the 969 runs they gave up was the third most by a team since 1940. The day he was named MVP A-Rod told ESPN “It's been a rough three years in Texas.”

Carlos Delgado .302/.426/.593/1.019 42 HR, 145 RBI, 109 BB

* Delgado had the biggest offensive season in the AL in 2003, leading the league with a 1.019 OPS and 145 RBIs. But where Delgado really upped his game was in 219 PA with RISP, he .357/.507/.650/1.157. The Blue Jays finished a respectable 86-76 for third place in the AL East -- possibly the toughest division in baseball with the Yankees and Red Sox who would match in in the ALCS. Delgado was both average in the field and on the base path. He made a final week push for the award by hitting four home runs in a game on September 25th. After finishing second the Blue Jays star told ESPN, “Obviously, I was expecting to get the award and that wasn't the case. If they were going to pick somebody from a team that did not make it to the playoffs I think it would have given me an edge, but that's what I get for thinking, I guess.”

Jorge Posada .281/.405/.922 30 HR, 101 RBI

* The Yankees won 101 games in 2003. Derek Jeter got injured on opening day and missed a month and a half. Jason Giambi had batted .330 from 2000-2002, but fell to .250 in 2003. Bernie Williams Batting average dropped 70 points from 2002 to 2003. After Alonso Soriano finished 3rd in the 2002 MVP voting, there was a narrative that a new bunch of Yankees had arrived with veterans Paul O’Neill, Tino Martinez, Scott Brosius and Chuck Knoblauch now gone. Posada had a solid season, but catchers just usually aren’t at the top of offensive categories. With the Yankees still winning 101 games with an adjusting team in 2003, Posada was seen as the best candidate on the league’s best team. Many voters felt it was enough to win the award when there wasn’t a clear favorite. 

Shannon Stewart .307/.364/.459 13 HR, 90 R, 73 RBI

* The strangest seasons to ever finish in the top five of an MVP. Stewart never made an all-star team in his fourteen year career. In 2003, Stewart played his first 71 games with the Blue Jays and Delgado before being traded to the Twins on July 15th where he played his final 65 games. At the time Minnesota was 7.5 games behind the Kansas City Royals in the AL Central. Then Minnesota would go 44-21 with Stewart playing on their way to winning the division (48-51 without Stewart overall). The Twins also went 9-4 in August and September against the eventual 43-119 Tigers. Many voters were persuaded that Stewart was the reason for the Twins midseason surge, but prior to Stewarts arrival the Twins had an 4.74 ERA and once he arrived that staff’s ERA dropped to 3.96. But after July 17th the Twins averaged 5.3 runs per game, while before they scored at a rate of 4.5. Stewart had a decent season with the Twins slashing .322/.384/.470, but his season numbers look to be a borderline all-star.

David Ortiz .288/.369/.592 31 HR, 101 RBI, 128 G

* After a solid 2002 season, the Twins non-tendered Big Papi which led to the Red Sox signing the slugger to one year $1.25 million contract contingent that he makes the team out of spring training. Ortiz only started 117 games (73 at DH) and pinch hit in another eleven games. Only Don Baylor in 1979 was a primary DH to win an MVP. Ortiz’s 31 homers with 101 RBIs and a .961 OPS were solid, but would eventually be one of his least productive seasons in Boston. Along with Ortiz’s surprise the Red Sox won 95 games and took the Wild Card.

Manny Ramirez .325/.427/.587 37 HR, 104 RBI, 117 R, 154 G

* Manny led the AL in OBP and lost out on the batting title to teammate Bill Mueller by a single point. Manny also finished second with a 1.014 OPS. What really hurt his case was comparing him to himself. Over the previous five seasons Manny averaged 0.98 RBIs per game (664 RBIs in 667 G), while that number fell to 0.68 per game in 2003. But it was tough to see Manny’s fault with a slashline of .338/.512/.603 with RISP in 215 PA. While Manny’s offense was superb, he was seen as arguably the worst outfielder in baseball. 

Nomar Garciaparra .301/.345/.524

* Nomar looked to be firmly in the MVP race, but he had a miserable final 25 games of the season where he hit .162 with only seven extra base hits and took him out of the race. While Red Sox players finished 5th, 6th and 7th in voting it was hard to see who voters felt was the team’s MVP. Each hit well, but were seen as liabilities defensively. 

Vernon Wells .317/.359/.550 215 H, 118 R, 117 RBI, 33 HR, 87 XBH

* Wells had the best year of his career in 2003. He led the AL with 215 hits, 49 doubles, and 87 extra base hits while playing center field. Wells would go on to win deserved gold gloves, but metrics were not as kind to him in 2003. The reason for Wells finishing below where his numbers would suggest is many voters valued his teammate Delgado as the team’s MVP candidate and couldn’t wrap their mind around having two candidates on a third place team.

Carlos Beltran .307/.389/.522 26 HR, 100 RBI, 102 R, 41 SB

* The Kansas City Royals had the second lowest payroll among MLB teams in 2003, and finished 83-79 despite a weak roster. Beltran was one of the best defensive players and base runners in baseball. His total zone rating had him saving 15 runs in center field and his 41 SBs in 45 attempts gave him the highest SB% (91.1) in the AL. Beltran’s game had zero weakness, and was among the very all-around players in the game.

Brett Boone .294/.366/.535 35 HR, 117 RBI, 111 R, 75 XBH

* After losing out on the 2001 AL MVP in a very tight vote to his teammate Ichiro, Boone had another career year in 2003. His 117 RBIs led the second baseman, and his 35 HRs finished second among his position in the AL.

0,Arctic_Summer,"The 1955 MVP was full of voting controversy as Roy Campanella edged Duke Snider. There was debate as to who was the better Dodger, who was New York’s best center fielder, and who was the best young player in baseball. Nine of the top 10 finishers in the voting found their way to Cooperstown. It was the first of roughly ten MVPs Willie Mays fans feel he was snubbed.

The race went 1) Roy Campanella 2) Duke Snider 3) Ernie Banks 4) Willie Mays 5) Robin Roberts 6) Ted Kluszewski 7) Don Newcombe 8) Stan Musial T9) Hank Aaron T9) Pee Wee Reese

Roy Campanella .318/.395/.583 32 HR, 107 RBI

* Campanella would win his third MVP of the previous five seasons. Seen as the best catcher of his era, Campanella threw out 23 of the 44 runners who attempted to steal a base off him for a caught stealing rate of 52%. Campbell only played in 123 (making 118 starts), and the Dodgers were 80 and 38 when he was in the lineup card as opposed to 18-17 when he didn’t go. Campanella was clutch with a .381 AVG and 1.097 OPS with RISP. The Dodgers won the NL pennant, and the now thirty-three year old Campanella was seen as their leader. 

Duke Snider .309/.418/.628/1.046 42 HR, 136 RBI, 126 R, 104 BB, 82 XBH

* In the 25 years since the MVP was introduced in 1931 this was the seventh time teammates finished first and second in voting in either league (there were only eight teams in each league at the time). Snider led the NL with 126 runs 136 RBIs and tied for the lead with 82 XBH, while finishing second in OBP (.418), SLG (.628), and OPS (1.046). Snider’s 42 home runs was his third consecutive season hitting at least 40 and would continue it for another two. Duke was the biggest contributor to a Dodgers offense that led the league with 857 runs scored (5.6 r/G), 96 more than any other team in the league. There was a lot of debate amongst Dodger fans and baseball fans on who was more deserving, Campanella or Snider. Controversy ensued as a story of a hospitalized voter sending a ballot listing Campanella both first and fifth without naming Snider, and instead of throwing out the ballot altogether Campanella was awarded a first place vote -- if that ballot was discarded or placed Snider in the top five he wins. The second Campanella was likely intended for his teammate. Baseball journalist Joe Posnanski discovered this later on. Bill James would say on the more deserving Dodger debate “It is pretty far-fetched to argue that Campanella was better than Snider. You would have to exaggerate his defensive value to heroic proportions.”

Ernie Banks .295/.345/.596 44 HR, 117 RBI, 98 R, 82 XBH

* Banks had his breakout year in 1954, hitting a single-season record 44 home runs by a shortstop. Banks also set a single-season record of five grand slams, going seven for twelve with two walls together with the bases loaded. Banks tied for the league-lead with 82 XBH, and was fourth with 117 RBIs. His Performance was not enough to help the lovable loser Cubs, who finished 72-81 for sixth place amongst eight teams.

Willie Mays .319/.400/.659/1.059 51 HR, 127 RBI, 123 R, 82 XBH, 24 SB

* Willie Mays is widely considered the greatest player of all-time. In 1954 he won the NL MVP and led the New York Giants to a World Series victory. 1955 Mays was just as good as any year in 21 year career. He led the NL with 51 HR, 13 3B, .659 SLG, 1.059 OPS, 382 TB and even 85.7 SB% while his 82 XBH tied for the league lead. Mays’ .319 AVG, 123 Runs, 127 RBIs, and 24 SB all ranked second in the league. His 9.1 bWAR and 9.0 fWAR all obviously led the league as Mays is considered by many the greatest center fielder of all-time -- but trying to evaluate 1950s defense is difficult today. With Mickey Mantle also at his peak in the AL New York’s three center fielder’ were future Hall of Famers Mays, Mantle, and Snider all at their apex in the 1950s. The Giants finished 80-74 for third place in the NL, while New York’s other two centerfielders played in the Yankees-Dodgers world series.

Stan Musial .319/.408/.566 33 HR, 107 RBI

* Already a three time NL MVP and three time runner-up Musial had his eight 100 RBI season and sixth 30 home run season. But as Musial played for the Cardinals for over twenty-three years, their worst season was 1955 as St. Louis went 68-86 finishing second to last in the NL.

Hank Aaron .314/.366/.540 27 HR, 106 RBI, 105 R

* In just his second season at age 21 Hank Aaron made his first all-star team in 1955 and led the league with 37 doubles. His 27 homers at him finish the season with 40 total in his career. This was also Aaron’s first 100 RBI season, he would go onto have 11 of them and still holds the most in MLB history at 2297. Aaron also started 26 games at second base, the most he would appear in the infield until the 1970s when he played first base. The Milwaukee Braves would finish second in the NL with an 85-69 record. 

Eddie Matthews .289/.413/.601/1.014 41 HR, 101 RBI, 108 R, 109 BB

* Matthews would finish 18th in NL MVP voting. Yet, he was among the best hitters and players in the NL. For the third consecutive year he hit more than 40 home runs and drove in more than 100 and became feared enough to lead the league in walks with 109. As the season uncluded, Mathews, still only twenty-three years old, had the most home runs (153) before turning twenty-four in baseball history.

The race went 1) Justin Verlander 2) Jacoby Ellsbury 3) Jose Bautista 4) Curtis Granderson 5) Miguel Cabrera 6) Robinson Cano 7) Adrian Gonzalez 8) Michael Young 9) Dustin Pedroia 10) Evan Longoria

Justin Verlander 24-5, 2.40 ERA, 251.0 IP, 250 K, 0.92 WHIP

* Verlander became the first pitcher in nine seasons to win at least twenty-four games. The Tigers went 25-9 in JV’s starts, while going 70-58 when he didn’t pitch. On July 21st the Tigers were tied for the AL Central lead, and that night began Verlander's streak of winning his next twelve starts with a 2.28 ERA in 87.0 innings. The Tigers won the division by 15 games. Verlander went at least eight innings in fourteen starts and at least seven in twenty-six starts. He led the AL in Wins (24), ERA (2.40), starts (34), strikeouts (250) and WHIP (0.92). A notable moment was his no-hitter thrown on May 7th, and taking a June 14th start five outs away before finishing with a two-hit shutout. He won the AL Cy Young unanimously, and finished first in the league in bWAR (8.6) but fWAR (6.5) was far lower.

Jacoby Ellsbury .321/.376/.552 32 HR, 105 RBI, 212 H, 119 R, 39 SB

* The Red Sox center fielder won the Comeback player of the year after only playing 18 games in 2010 because of various injuries. Ellsbury had 32 homers and 105 RBIs, nearly becoming the second player in MLB history to hit the century mark from the leadoff spot alone (97 RBIs in 144 games at the top of the lineup). These impressive RBI totals were because Ellsbury hit .366 with a 1.111 OPS with RISP in 145 plate appearances (PA). Those numbers rose to a .400 AVG and 1.227 OPS in 70 PA with two-out and RISP. Playing centerfield, Elssbury was also rated well above average with 9 DRS, which helped him win his first gold glove. A speedy baserunner Ellsbury did swipe 39 bases but also got caught stealing 15 times. Ellsbury led the league in both extra-base hits (83), total bases (364), fWAR (9.5), while finishing first among position players in bWAR (8.3). The Red Sox entered September with a division lead and nine games up on the wild card, but went 7-20 to finish 90-72 and not make the postseason. Yet Ellsbury was the only bright spot in that 27 games span alashing .358/.400/.667 with 8 homers 21 RBIs, and 22 runs scored.

Jose Bautista .302/.447/.608/1.056 43 HR, 103 RBI, 132 BB

* Bautista had his best season in 2011, leading the league in home runs (43), walks (132), slugging (.608) and OPS (1.056). Bautista was also tied with Ellsbury for the lead in bWAR (8.3). But what really hurt his case was the Blue Jays finishing fourth in the AL East at 81-81 and his situational hitting. Bautista hit .245 with a .436 SLG with RISP in 110 ABs, and that may have been because he got nothing to hit because he also walked 64 for a .519 OBP in those situations. His AVG and SLG fell to .216 and .378 in 67 PAs with two-out and RISP, while his OBP went up to .567. While Bautista was clearly the best hitter in the AL, at best he was close to average in the outfield and on the base path. 

Curtis Granderson .262/.364/.552 41 HR, 119 RBI, 136 R, 25 SB

* The Yankees manager Joe Girardi said in late August that his center fielder was his MVP pick because of getting runs. Granderson led the AL with 136 runs scored (fifteen more than anyone else) and 119 RBIs. While finishing second in the league with 41 homers. From 1948 through 2010 there were 14 players who led their league in both runs scored and runs batted in, and 11 won MVP (along with Kemp in the NL, it happened in both leagues during 2011 and neither won MVP). Granderson played a premium position at a solid level, and helped the Yankees take 97 games and the AL East title. Even though he led the league in RBIs, he left many on the table in the Yankees lineup slashing .242/.303/.516 with RISP in 188 PA and .208/.266/.389 with two-out and RISP in 78 PA. In his final 35 games he had a .188 AVG as New York clinched the division. 

Miguel Cabrera .344/.448/.586/1.033 30 HR, 105 RBI, 108 BB, 197 H

* In 2011 Miguel Cabrera won his first of three consecutive batting titles by leading the AL with a .344 AVG. Cabrera, playing his eighth full season in the majors,  led the league with a .448 OBP, 48 doubles and 308 times on-base. His 1.033 OPS finished second to Bautista. Cabrera led the AL Central winning Tigers in runs, hits, extra-base hits, homers, runs batted in and across the slash line. But at the time, many saw it as a down year for Miggy because he hit 30 home runs and batted in 105. Over his first seven full seasons he averaged 34 homers and 117 runs batted in. One may think that his situational hitting was the reason for him not driving in runs at his normal rate, but it was quite the opposite. In 2011 Miggy hit .388 with a 1.191 OPS with RISP in 197 PA, and slashed .382/.539/.724 in 102 PA with two-outs and RISP. Entering August the Tigers were 57-51 and 2.5 games up in the AL Central, then Miggy slashed .408/.491/.648 the rest of the way as the Tigers went 38-16 and won the division by 16 games.

Robinson Cano .302/.349/.533 28 HR, 118 RBI, 188 H, 81 XBH

* With Jeter, A-Rod, and Texiera past their peak, Cano was now seen as the Yankees best player, and one of the best all-around players in baseball. Cano fell one RBI (118) shy of the league lead behind his teammate. Cano’s season was also highlighted by winning the home run derby in Phoenix, and his 29 homers on the season were the third most by a middle infielder in the league. His 81 extra-base hits only trailed Ellsbury in all of baseball, and in the field he became one premier second baseman in baseball. 2011 was the second of five consecutive seasons where Cano would finish top six in the AL MVP voting.

Adrian Gonzalez .338/.410/.548 27 HR, 117 RBI, 213 H, 108 R

* The Red Sox acquired Gonzalez in the offseason prior, and it paid off immediately. Entering August first the Red Sox were leading the AL East and on pace for 100 wins (66-40) as Gonzalez at the time was leading the league with a .357 AVG and 90 RBIs looking to be the frontrunner for the MVP award. Gonzalez didn’t play badly the rest of the way, but his numbers fell and the Red Sox collapsed and didn’t make the postseason. His 213 hits were tied for the most in the AL. Gonzalez only made three errors and 12 DRS made him an elite first baseman. 

Michael Young .338/.380/.474 11 HR, 106 RBI, 213 H

* Young was proving to be one of the most consistent players of the previous decade. In 2011 he tied for the league lead with 213 hits, his sixth 200 hit season. A highlight also included his 2,000th career hit, the first player in a Rangers uniform to get there. His .338 AVG and 106 RBIs were career highs. His .377 AVG with RISP were a huge help to the Rangers lineup, as for the first time in his career Young was the Rangers’ primary cleanup hitter (starting 89 games fourth in the lineup). In 2004 Young moved from 2B to SS for the acquisition of Alfonso Soriano, then to 3B in 2009 for the arrival of Elvis Andrus, and now in 2011 to DH after signing Adrian Beltre. Young’s consistency in the lineup was important for the 96-win Rangers, as Nelson Cruz, Josh Hamilton and Beltre all missed significant time due to injury. Yet, his defensive versatility was just as important as he started games at each infield spot (39 at 3B, 36 at 1B, 14 at 2B, 1 SS).

Dustin Pedroia .307/.387/.474 21 HR, 91 RBI, 102 R, 26 SB

* The 2008 AL MVP had arguably his best season in 2011, hitting a career-high 21 home runs. Being one of the best middle infielders in baseball, Pedroia finished 3rd in both bWAR (8.0) and fWAR (7.9) among AL position players. After a disappointing first two months of the season, Pedroia would get hot with a .342 AVG and .959 OPS in his final 104 games. Between the Red Sox miserable September and many MVP candidates on the team Pedroia fell in the race.

Evan Longoria .244/.355/.495 31 HR, 99 RBI

* The most memorable moment of the season -- and one of the best in baseball history -- was Longoria's walk-off home run against the Yankees on the season’s final day to clinch the Wild Card. Longoria’s eight inning three run blast also helped the Rays comeback from a seven-run deficit in game 162. Longoria struggled with injuries and had his worst season in his then four year year career, but still finished with 31 homers and 99 RBIs. Also due to his exceptional play at third base, Longoria finished 7th in the AL with a 7.2 bWAR.

0,Arctic_Summer,"The 2007 NL MVP was full of debate with many players representing different arguments such as counting stats vs rate statistics, hitters ballpark, home runs and RBIs vs all-around production.

The Race went 1) Jimmy Rollins 2) Matt Holliday 3) Prince Fielder 4) David Wright 5) Ryan Howard 6) Chipper Jones 7) Jake Peavy 8) Chase Utley 9) Albert Pujols 10) Hanley Ramirez

Jimmy Rollins .296/.344/.531 778 PA, 129 R, 212 H, 30 HR, 94 RBI, 88 XBH, 41 SB

* Rollins was the Phillies leader. The Phillies were down seven games in the NL East race to the Mets with seventeen games remaining, then the Phillies went 13-4 and won the division on the season’s final day. Rollins was seen as the best glove at shortstop in baseball, and won his first gold glove. Although he was seen as clutch, his OPS fell over those final seventeen games. His clutch narrative continued as many pointed out he almost had 100 RBIs (he had 94) from the leadoff spot (he started 139 games leadoff and the other 23 in the three-hole). Rollins hit .272 with RISP and that dropped to .239 with two out and RISP. Many loved to point out that Rollins had a 20-20-20-20 season (20 HRs, 20 2B, 20 3B, 20 SB), as both Rollins and Curtis Granderson became the third and fourth player ever to do so and the first since Willie Mays did 50 years prior. But Rollins' season can be summed up as a compiler. He set the all-time single season plate appearance record being up 778 times. And his league leading 139 runs were helped out by 2006 MVP Ryan Howard and Chase Utley hitting behind him.

Matt Holliday .340/.405/.607 36 HR, 137 RBI, 120 R, 216 H,92 XBH

* Holiday led the league in AVG (.340), hits (216), doubles (50), extra-base hits (92), RBIs (137), and total bases (386). While Holliday’s numbers were remarkable, many loved to point out the Coors field effect. Holliday's batting average dropped 75 points on the road (.376 to .301), his slugging dropped 237 points (.722 to .485) and his OPS dropped 297 points (1.157 to .860). He also had 25 homers in Denver compared to 11 everywhere else. This led many to believe Holliday was a solid player, but Coors field made him an MVP candidate. While many were focused on the historically hitter friendly park, holiday was clutch down the stretch. The Rockies won 12 of their final 13 games -- including a game 163 against the Padres for the wild card -- to make the postseason. In that stretch Holliday slashed .442/.532/.846/1.378 with five homers, 17 RBIs, and 16 runs. Holliday was seen as nothing special in the outfield, while his base running made for a heated debate after a walk run scored in game 163 where replays showed he didn’t actually touch the plate. 

Prince Fielder .288/.395/.618 50 HR, 119 RBI, 90 BB

* Prince a league leading 50 home runs in 2007, and along with his dad Cecil became the first father-son duo to have a 50 homer in major league history. But Fielder didn’t rate well beyond the plate and had a low WAR -- bWAR (3.6) and fWAR (4.7) -- for someone who was as productive as he was at the plate. Meaning he was miserable everywhere else. The Brewers finished 83-79, and he was often overshadowed during the season by his teammate Ryan Braun, the NL Rookie of the Year winner.

David Wright .325/.416/.584, 30 HR, 107 RBI, 34 SB

* The Mets blowing a seven game division lead with seventeen games left probably cost Wright the MVP award. Voters couldn’t see themselves awarding a player who let his team sink when it mattered most. Yet, Wright was phenomenal in those final seventeen games hitting .397 with a 1.027 OPS. For his ability at third base and stealing 34 bases Wright was becoming known as possibly the best all-around player in baseball. Wright became the third 30-30 HR-SB player in Mets history. He led the NL in fWAR (8.4) and finished second to Albert Pujols in bWAR (8.3). Wright even upped his game with runners on base, hitting .332 with a 1.004 OPS. Wright didn’t lead the league in any offensive category which made his stats seem less eye-popping, but was near the top of every category. Although his team’s position hurt his award chances, he was still on a second place team that won 88 games.

Ryan Howard .268/.392/.584 47 HR, 136 RBI

* Howard was the reigning NL MVP winner. 2007 was the only season from 2006 through 2009 where Howard didn’t lead the league in RBIs, falling an RBI shy of Holiday for the title. While his 47 homers, 136 RBI and .976 OPS were impressive most saw Howard -- like Fielder -- as a liability everywhere else. His 2.9 bWAR and 3.2 fWAR suggest he didn’t lead the Phillies to the division title. 

Chipper Jones .337/.425/..604/1.029 29 HR, 102 RBI, 134 G

* At age 35 Chipper led the NL in OPS at 1.029 and fell three points shy of Holliday for the batting title. He broke the century mark in both runs (108) and RBIs (102), and his bWAR of 7.6 ranked among the top of baseball. Had Chipper not missed 28 games and done better than a .241 AVG in 54 ABs in two-outs and RISP he may have won the award.

Jake Peavy 2.54 ERA, 1.06 WHIP, 240 K, 19-6 

* Peavy won the NL Cy Young award unanimously. Leading the league with 19 wins, 240 strikeouts, 1.06 WHIP and a 2.54 ERA. But with the season on the line in a game 163 tiebreaker, Peavy didn’t win his 20th game and instead gave up six runs in 6.1 IP. Along with another start in September where he gave up eight runs, Peavy could have helped the Padres clinch a playoff spot and failed to do so. With a 2.10 ERA on september 1st, Peavy was in the MVP race.

Chase Utley .332/.410/.566 103 RBI

* Overshadowed by two other MVP winning teammates, Utley was the Phillies best player in 2007 when on the field. Had a hit by pitch not broken his hand at the end of July causing him to get surgery and miss over a month Utley would have been firmly at the top of the debate. 

Albert Pujols .327/.429/.568 32 HR, 103 RBI

* In 2006 Pujols finished second in a controversial MVP vote. And 2007 saw him not even enter the MVP race due to setting career-lows in his seventh season of home runs (32), RBIs (103), runs (99), and XBH (71). He had the second lowest AVG of his career (.327) and OPS (.997) while leading the league grounding into double plays with 27. The reigning World Champion Cardinals went 78-84. It got so bad that his own manager Tony La Russa even left him on the bench the entire all-star game, as if so many other players had passed him making it difficult to find a moment for him to be on the field with baseball’s best. The Machine wasn’t happy about his time on the bench. Pujols also led the NL in bWAR (8.7) and was second in fWAR (7.7). His numbers across the board were MVP caliber, just not at the level of his usual argument for greatest right-handed hitter ever. Pujols would go on to win the MVP the next two years. 

Hanley Ramirez .332/.386/.562 125 R, 212 H, 29 HR, 83 XBH

* The 2006 NL Rookie of the Year proved to be one of the game's best players in 2007. The shortstop was stuck on the 91 loss Marlins but still had a monster season. And he would eventually finish second in the 2009 MVP.

0,Arctic_Summer,"2000 AL MVP had one of the deepest ballots (ballots include 10 players) we’ll ever find in a race

1. Jason Giambi 2) Frank Thomas ) A-Rod 4) Carlos Delgado 5) Pedro Martinez 6) Edgar Martinez 6) Manny Ramirez 8) Darin Erstad 9) Nomar Garciaparra 10) Derek Jeter

Breaking down each player

Giambi .336/.476/.647/1.123 OPS with 43 HRs, 137 RBI and 137 BB

* Led the A’s to 91 wins and the AL West title, Giambi had a monster season at the plate and with one of the best seasons ever in the batter’s box. This made his argument for and against are straight forward. Giambi was the catalyst offensively for a team that scored 947 runs. Giambi made 148 starts and accumulated 664 plate appearances. Although he didn’t provide much on the base path or on defense (Giambi played first base and DH 24 times), there was a gap in the Batter’s box between Giambi and the rest of the field.

Thomas 328/.436/.625/1.061 43 HR, 143 RBI, 115 R, 112 BB

* Thomas was in a similar argument to Giambi. And it shows how voters viewed the award at the time, as the two took 24 of the 28. Like Giambi, Thomas was among the leaders in RBIs, HRs, BBs and putting up big numbers across the slash line. Thomas played in 159 and had 707 plate appearances for the 95 win AL Central Chicago White Sox. The Sox also baseball with 978 runs scored. The Big Hurt was the main reason with his presence in the batter’s box. Thomas though was primarily a DH with 127 starts that didn’t include fielding. Winning the MVP would make him the second primary DH to win (1979 Don Baylor)

A-Rod 316/.420/.606/1.026 41 HR, 134 R, 132 RBI, 100 BB

* Although A-Rod has said his two best seasons were 1996 and 2007, bWAR would disagree and say it was this season at 10.4. Alex played in 148 games, all starts at shortstop and only made 10 errors at the premium position with a phenomenal 98.6% fielding percentage. The Mariners won 91 games and took the wild card (although had the same record as division champ the A’s), and A-Rod carried the offense with Ken Griffey Jr. having been traded to Cincinnati before the season. It was clear this season who the best all-around player in the game was, even if there were a couple hitters slightly better. As one of the faster players in the game, Alex was also an above average base runner and led all position players in WAR. This being his contract year worked out perfectly, and A-Rod would get $252 million -- double the guarantees more than any athlete ever and worth more than the value of many MLB franchises at the time. 

Carlos Delgado .344/.470/.664/1.134 44 HR, 137 RBI, 196 H, 123 BB, 115 R

* Delgado was the one player who could truly argue that he was a better all-around hitter than Giambi. Delgado also didn’t miss a game for the Blue Jays, making all 162 starts at 1B. Turley a contender for the award in every sense, voters didn’t value knocked Delgado compared to Giambi and Thomas because the Blue Jays only went 83-79, finishing 3rd in the AL East. 

Pedro Martinez 1.74 ERA, 284 K, 11.8 K/9, 8.88 K/BB

* Pedro famously finished second in the 1999 AL MVP after two voters snubbed him from their ballot altogether. But 2000 may have been the greatest pitching season of all-time (MLB ranked it #1 in their top nine pitching seasons ever in 2009). He led all players in bWar at 11.7 and set the all-time WHIP single season record at 0.737. His 1.74 ERA was the lowest ERA during the American league DH era (still standing for a 162 game season). The entire AL’s ERA was 4.91 and Roger Clemens finished second in ERA at 3.70 proved how amazing Pedro was. The one knock on Pedro is he started only 29 games and pitched 217.0 Innings. Unfortunately voters held it against him that Boston only won 85 games, and Pedro finished with only 18 wins (deGrom would think that’s a decent amount though). 

Edgar Martinez .324/.423/.579/1.002 145 RBI

* The future Hall of Famer was in his peak years and led the league in RBIs. The DH was a huge part of the Mariners winning 91 games, and provided A-Rod nice protection by usually hitting the spot behind him at cleanup

Manny Ramirez 351/.457/.697/1.154 122 RBI 38 HR

* In his final season in Cleveland, Manny led baseball with a 1.154 OPS and the highest of his career. Manny even had more RBIs (122) than games played (118). But the games played took him out of the race, which he may have even won had he not missed 44 games due to injury.

Darin Erstad 355/.409/.541/.951 240 H, 25 HR, 100 RBI

* The only outfielder in the top ten, Erstad had 240 hits - a total that has since been only passed by Ichiro. But Erstad didn’t find many ways to get on base and had the lowest OBP of any top ten finisher. Erstad’s bWAR (8.3) does rank second on the list.

Nomar Garciaparra 372/.434/.599/1.033 21 HR, 96 RBI

* Peak Nomar had a monster year with a .372 batting average -- still the highest number of the 21st century. Playing a premium position at short also made him more valuable, but he didn’t play it well. Also he only made 136 starts do to injury dropped him down to the bottom of the top ten.

Derek Jeter .339/.416/.481/.896 119 R, 201 H

* The only player on the World Champions to appear on the list. Jeter had his third consecutive 200 hit season in 200 and played a premium position at shortstop - although not particularly well. Jeter hit well and got on base, bu didn’t have a high batting average.

0,Rolo_Tamasi,"Framework to overhaul baseball and get a new collective marketing agreement:

My goals: Eliminate tanking, make all owners want to field competitive teams, allow players and owners to equally share in revenue, improve the pace/entertainment of games.

Salaries/Revenue:

\-Owner would need to full open their books to an impartial third party that players agree upon.

\-Owners and players would settle on a % of overall revenues that they would receive - let's say 50%.  This 50% would be divided by the number of teams and be not only a salary cap, but a floor as well (see the next items).  No team could spend more than this amount and would need to take this into account when it comes to in-season trades.

\-Each player would qualify for ML pay credits based on their salary divided by the number of games they are on the active MLB roster for whatever team(s) they are playing throughout the year.

\-At the end of the year, each team's portion of player salaries that was not spent would be divided out and given (based on a ratio of the pay credits formula above) to all players that were on their MLB roster for at least one game to bring that team's salary spend up to the agreed %.

\-Revenue sharing between teams would need to be more like the NFL with all gate/concessions/tv revenue split something like 60/40 by the home/away teams.

&amp;#x200B;

Rules Changes:

\-Add the DH in the National league

\-Institute a pitch clock as well as forcing the batter to stay in the batter's box.  Perhaps give each pitcher and hitter a number of times they can receive exceed this per game without penalty, much like the current limitation on mound visits (SP - 3 times, RP - 1 time, hitter - 1 time).

\-Eliminate the shift and if possible, move back the fences at all parks 10-20 feet to make put more balls in play (less strikeouts/homeruns).

\-Allow unlimited relief pitcher changes (without making them pitch to three batters), but have pitchers to be already in the team dugout and ready to come in instead of having to run in from the dugout.  They will have 30 seconds once they reach the mound to take practice pitches and there will be a picture-in-picture tv commercial like what is done in soccer games instead of cutting away completely.

\-Have a runner starting on second base in extra innings once the game makes it past the 10th inning (only during regular season).

&amp;#x200B;

Re-alignment/interleague play:

\-Add two further teams to get to 32 teams overall, with 4 8-team divisions.

\-Have the top in each 8 team division make the playoffs along with a best of three play-in series from the next two in each division.

\-As there will be salary parity, the un-balanced schedule can remain within each 8-team division, though there should always be at least one home and away series between each team in each league once a year.

\-Remove all interleague play or at most keep a single ""rivalry"" once a year for a home and away series.

&amp;#x200B;

Further radical ideas:

\-Have a ""draft pick"" tournament of all teams that did not make the playoffs to determine the draft order of the first round of the next draft.  Players on teams that did make the playoffs will all be given large enough bonuses to remove any impetus for managers/team wanting them to tank.

\-Change the draft to be more like the NHL draft where high school players are handled.  The rights of such players that are drafted can be held by the team that drafted them until their next draftable time (for high school players, the next period would be after their sophomore year of college like it is now) for a cost of X dollars.  This would bring back a manner of the old draft and follow option that was around a while back and allow teams to take a hedged flyer on a high end high school player and retain their rights through the next draft.  If that player did not sign, they would then go back into the following season's draft (after their Junior season) without restrictions.  Each draft position will have a specific value that is set.  This will eliminate negotiation/holdouts/etc.  Institute an international player draft.

\-Allow managers to give up a full inning of batting for an extra out in a current inning (For example the bases are loaded in the 6th, your team is down 2 runs and a hitter just struck out for the 3rd out.  Instead of losing what might be your best opportunity to tie the game, you bring up another batter, but lose your 9th inning to bat).  This will bring in some strategy to the game with the benefit of possibly shortening games by 1-2 innings, but not doing so arbitrability just to shorten them.",1641317011,False,False,1,Some ideas I've been noodling around to possibly solve the labor crisis and make baseball more exciting,1.0,0,4642,805

0,FLBoy19,"The 2015 Playoffs were pretty great, got to see the Royals ride a great core to another AL championship and actually finish off it and win a WS over the Mets. However, possibly the biggest story of the playoffs was Daniel Murphy. Murphy had always been a solid hitter with mediocre defense which made him a solid MLB starter at 2nd for the first half of his career, in 2015 he posted a .281/.322/.770 slash line with 14 HRs and 73 RBIs for a total 1.9 (Baseball reference numbers) oWAR and 1.2 WAR total. However in the 2015 postseason Daniel Murphy went crazy, in 14 games hitting .328/.391/1.115 with 7 HRs and basically dragged the Mets past the Cubs and the Dodgers. His postseason led to the start of the Statcast or Launch angle era where players began selling out to loft the ball leading to the 3 true outcome baseball we now days watch. To me I hate this type of baseball, being a mid-90s kid I personally think the best baseball I have watched was from 2007 to 2015. This was more traditional offensive baseball so I want to look at two players who played a premium defensive position one from Pre- Statcast era and one that occurred during the Statcast Era. When out of primary position they played at positions that their oWAR would be affected due to the expected offensive production by an average player.

Player A- Pre-Statcast- 136 games played at primary position, 20 played out of position for 156 games total- Slash - .301/.373/.837 with 13 homers, 69 RBIs, 53 doubles, and 73 runs. 

Player B- Post-Statcast-  120 games started at primary position with 124 games played total at position, 40 games started out of position playing in 161 games total. Slashed- .273/.316/.859 with 48 homeruns, 121 RBIs, 24 doubles, 88 runs.

Player A produced oWAR of 5.6, while Player B produced an oWAR of 4.6.

Player A was Johnathan Lucroy's fantastic 2014 season when he was chasing the doubles record and playing great defense behind the plate. 

Player B was Salvador Perez's 2021 year, which I heard people hail as one the best offensive catcher season of all-time. It wasn't close to Lucroy's 2014, granted Perez played more games at DH would have negatively effected his oWAR value, Lucroy's out of position games was at 1st which would have effected his oWAR value as well. 

What does this mean? Well the current offensive philosophy dictates that a low OBP player that mashes homeruns is a measurably worse player then a guy lighter hitter or drills XBH. Even if in this case the player had 35 more homeruns then player who gets on base, gets XBH without trading avg for power. Also a great example for people to look at how flawed the current hitting philosophy is in the MLB.

* the Giants and Angels were put in objects/things due to them not actually being people
* the Nationals, Mets, and Phillies in this case are the people of a Nation, of a Metropolitan, and of Philadelphia, respectively, and therefore fall under the ""people"" category
* if the animal, person, or thing can and normally does harm other animals, persons, or things they are allowed to do so within the extent of the gameplay.  For example, Diamondbacks are venomous and will bite things and kill them- during the game the Diamondbacks can not go and bite the whole other team rendering them useless, however as a strategic advantage they may bite someone running the base path to slow them down, same goes for other carnivorous animals and people who are known to have weaponry/willingness to attack. 
* Any and all projectile weaponry can only be used by a person once per at bat.  For example a Yankee can shoot someone trying to field their hit, but once the shot is taken they must wait until their next at bat to try and shoot someone else, this means they must choose between shooting the person fielding the ball, or the person guarding the base and can not simply shoot the whole team for a homerun each time.
* Innominate objects can move, ie statues can act like what they are made to represent and apparel can skirt around the field.

Feel free to make your educated guess from the above divisions, for a full scouting report on each team continue...

# Division 1- The Animals

* **Diamondbacks-** For this exercise we will say they can grip a bat with their tail to swing, and their strike zone is very very small and low to the ground which results in a ton of walks per game.  On the pitching side, when they work together they could use three snakes to slingshot the ball across the plate, however this leaves two gaps somewhere in the field, and their fielding is rather awful.  However, as mentioned above they have a trick up their fang in their venom, which they can use to temporarily immobilize any fielders they come across, if they can catch them.
* **Cubs-** These baby bears can throw and hit decently, and while they may not have the strength of full grown bears they do have some power and the advantage of a smaller strike zone.  Their lack of speed hurts them on the base path and in the field, but their ability to use their hands or mouth to catch the ball is helpful.  While running they also can help mess up they play with their sharp fangs and big paws.
* **Tigers-** Faster and more violent than cubs, the Tigers are an absolute menace on the base path, the tricky part for them is getting there.  These Tigers use their mouth to hold and swing the bat, while they also catch the ball with their mouth, pitching and throwing requires them to focus hard as they throw the ball from their mouth as well.
* **Orioles/Cardinals/Blue Jays-** The birds, their lack of strength and diminutive size leads to very few hits outside of the infield, however, this group has the advantage of a small strike zone and the ability to fly high and then back down to avoid tags, or attacks, from their in-division rivals- leading to many walks and steals.  They grip the bat and ball with their feet, and their ability to fly leads to very good fielding and very few homeruns. 
* **Marlins/Rays-** As the only marine animals the Marlins and Rays should win nearly every home game (accept when they play each other).  When they travel away you can tell they are very uncomfortable as they play like fish out of water, as they are in fact fish out of water.  

# Division 2- The People

* **Braves-** Native Americans invented many sports that have influenced our modern day games, combine that with the strength and fitness of hunting every day and you have a well trained group ready to tomahawk chop their way to the finals.
* **Royals-** ""Off with their heads"" the Royals are a difficult out on any day, they might not be too good at baseball, but upset them too much and who know what is waiting for you back in the dugout.
* **Dodgers-** Good luck tagging these guys out as they run the base path, too bad for them that you can simply touch the base instead... 
* **Brewers-** What better way to distract the opponent than to brew them endless beer until they are a sloppy mess?  With their endless supply of beer the Brewers can replace all water in the stadium with beer, leading to easy wins against drunk teams... as long as their opponent and not themselves drink their own supply. 
* **Twins-** Are you seeing double?  Nope just the twins in town.  With 18 people in the field their defense can be quiet stellar, and with two people in the batter box they are bound to hit something right?  Better just hope that the twins are athletic, and that they hit the ball and not each other.
* **Yankees/Rangers-** They might not be the most athletic, but their added bonus of rifles and revolvers help make up for any lack in athletic ability.
* **Athletics-** Some of the most Athletic people you have ever met, their raw talent and athletic abilities blow everyone else away- should be easy wins if your opponents didn't have guns, tomahawks, and beer.
* **Pirates/Mariners-** These swashbuckling opponents might not have the sturdiest of legs, but come visit them at their home field out at sea and it is you who will be leaving sick.  In addition to their unique homefield advantage, they too carry the casual side arm and sword in case their is need of it.
* **Padres-** These Friars have God on their side, but that doesn't necessarily turn them into Loyola University of Chicago.  For every athletic friar you get, you also get a friar who decided to spend the last five years living in a cave living off mushrooms.
* **Nationals/Mets/Phillies-** Every game nine randomly selected people are chosen from the nation, metropolitan, or Philadelphia respectfully to start for their team.  You might end up with 9 MVPS in your lineup or you might end up with 9 of [these guys.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrqTVFuHxkQ)

# Division 3- The Objects and Things

* **Guardians-** You ever play baseball against 43 foot tall winged concrete statues? No? Well good luck.  Thankfully their are only 8 of them.
* **Rockies-** Ever try and hit a ball over a mountain?  Well you might want to practice for when the Rockies roll into town (you might also want to warn your town).  I am not sure how they hit or throw, but at least their defense is stellar (try sliding into first or running into home with a mountain in the way).
* **Astros-** I honestly would have no idea how this would work, any time they touch the ball it bursts into flames, probably would end up in a bunch of forfeits unless they used some fireproof trashcan to hold the ball.
* **Red Sox/White Sox/Reds-** I would recommend not wearing socks to any of these matches, as they might just turn against you and start working for the other team, other than that I am not sure what else they could do.  
* **Giants-** Like the guardians but not stone, the giants are a very formidable foe.  Their only downfall might be their size as they try and grip a tiny baseball and little bat.
* **Angels-** If we are talking Angels in the Outfield Angels then good luck playing against the best that baseball has to offer, if we are talking biblically described angels then good luck in not being scared shitless and forfeiting on the spot.

Draft pick one should go to the top winning percent team who missed the playoffs. So if there are 10 teams in the playoffs, team 11 should be pick 1. Through rank 30 getting pick 20. The remaining picks should go in order of elimination with the higher win percent getting the higher pick. 

Look at the teams that just missed this year? Or the teams the just traded everything away to get better picks? Or teams that just did nothing because they knew it was their best shot?

Fans bring in the bulk of all the revenue. That includes not just at game revenue with their price gouging on tickets and concessions and merchandise. So why not let the fans have a seat at that table? We're the ones spending the money. Why can't we argue for cheaper ticket prices and lower concession prices and maybe being able to afford a nice jearsey that wouldn't cost 2/3 of my paycheck. It's obvious corporate green. But what does the lockout do? Who does it affect? The fans. The fans are the ones who are affected by the lockout. So they're still making money because we're still spending money on merchandise while they're not playing, but we don't have the luxury of being entertained by the said sport at the time at it's specific arena, stadium, etc. Why must the fans be punished by taking away an entertainment that a lot of us have deeply grown roots into the sports and sports teams. And then the players and owners want to cause a lockout because they can't agree to both be further greedy and want more money on top of certain rule changes that should just be decided and agreed upon by a third party. But ultimately in the end the fans are the ones who are punished, even though we're the ones spending our hard-earned money that a lot of us have to do a lot of physical labor to make that money, but we can't see it or watch a game even on TV because The players association and the owner's commission can't decide who gets to be more greedy. So again fans deserve a seat at the table. We'd be the best mediators, and since we're the cash cow we should be able to throw in our demands since they want to lock it out well let's lock it out but we're going to let the fans get in on this lockouts you want to take away our entertainment well we want some things then in return. Thank you for reading this rant if you made it to the end if not I don't blame you but this is been a topic that has bothered me for a long time about lockouts and how greedy and disgustingly asinine the whole process is by both sides.

And if a pitcher strikes out 3 in a row he's allowed to bean the first batter in the next inning he pitches....with them announcing they used 2 different weighted balls its already there.

I can't find anything here or on pro baseball reference that points to it and that could really be interesting to prove or disprove whether it's better to pull a starter on the first cycle of the batting order once a certain number of hits are on the board.

Off the top of my head, I feel as if it has to rise cumulatively as the hitter gets more used to the pitch selection but this could be one of those counterintuitive things where they actually do better on the first frame.",1638296540,False,False,1,Is there any data out there to show which at bat has a higher .BA?,1.0,0,662,124

Career stats: 110.2WAR, .298/.421/.557, 536HRs, 153SBs, 2415 hits, 1509RBIs

Career highlight: out of many we can choose his memorable home run race with Roger Maris to try to beat the Babes record is one of the best

Best season (1952): .353/.464/.705, 188 hits, 52HR, 130RBIs, 10SBs

Fun feat: Mantle was a media darling so much that he was the one people wanted to break Babes single season record. He never did end up doing it but his teammate Roger Maris and him had a home run battle to rival McGwire vs Sosa to beat the Babes record

Analysis: Mickey is one of the GOATs and that cannot be denied. His speed was electric, his fielding was incredible and his ability to hit from both sides of the plate was something many players didn’t find success with at the time. He was a legend not only for the Yankees but in the sport with media talking about how far his home runs would go and how great he was and every bit of it was true.

I'm a Mets fan and I remember being excited when he signed.  He played great....then they traded him back to the Dodgers.  I know the team stunk and they were dumping everyone.

Career OPS+
Trout 176
Ted Williams 191

Lou Gehrig 179

Based on career averages right now, he’s still significantly worse than Williams and Babe Ruth 

It’s also important to note that Trout hasn’t had his down years yet. Pujols had a 170 OPS+ in STL and now has a career 144. Trout’s career averages will most likely drop as well, putting him farther behind.

Degrom has a similar story

Kershaw 155  2454.2 innings 
Pedro 154       2827.2 innings 

While Degrom has a higher ERA+ he also has thrown significantly fewer innings. As he continues to pitch and gets injured and worn down his career averages will get worse. 

Kershaw’s ERA+ for the last 4 years are 142, 137, 202(shortened season), 115

0,Gemnist,"With the VC results being announced in a couple of weeks, I figured it was time we could make predictions on who the Cooperstown class of 2022 will be, so here's mine. I'll start with each committee and then go through each person on the BBWAA ballot.

EARLY BASEBALL ERA COMMITTEE: There's a lot of historic players worthy of consideration (including a giant host of Negro League players), and with this being the committee's first ever meeting it could go any which way. We've got the first African-American minor league player, the Josh Gibson of pitchers, and #4 on the longest hitting streak ranking all in the running. With this first time, though, I have a gut feeling they're going to pick someone who was actually alive at the same time as them, so my money's on either Allie Reynolds or Buck O'Neil getting voted in. 

GOLDEN DAYS ERA COMMITTEE: For this one, I'm mainly going off of previously results. My heart says Roger Maris deserves to be in, and there seems to be a pretty strong following for Minnie Minoso and Dick Allen online. But with how well he did the last time (being a single vote shy of enshrinement), I'm predicting Tony Oliva will be the one to get in, with Jim Kaat a close second (it also helps that they're, you know, alive)

CURT SCHILLING: I'm going to say this right now: Schilling deserves to be in. If Max Scherzer and Justin Verlander are basically locks at this point, Schilling should be that and then some. And to be clear, I HATE his politics. But that shouldn't be the reason why someone doesn't get elected into the Hall. The only real barrier should be if you're a genuine criminal (more on that later). As for whether or not he'll get in, that will depend on how the BBWAA reacts to him famously ""cancelling"" them and asking to be taken off the ballot. Maybe they'll be offended enough to grant his request via voting, or maybe they'll vote him in to spite him. Who even knows, given how fickle the BBWAA is, but with Schilling just under the mark as is it could go either way.

BARRY BONDS AND ROGER CLEMENS: Ooo boy. Yeah, I don't think they're getting in. Not only has MLB refused to pass an olive branch to anyone confirmed to have PEDs, but Bonds and Clemens both refuse to restore their reputation whatsoever (which might actually help two other players, but they're coming later). If they get into the Hall, it will be decades from now when steroids are in the rearview mirror and both players are either pushing daisies or on the cusp of doing so. It really stinks as someone who adored Clemens as a kid, but it's also their own fault.

SCOTT ROLEN: Rolen's been on a massive upward trajectory in the ballots, and it pretty much guarantees he'll get in. If it doesn't happen this year, it'll be next year for sure. 

OMAR VIZQUEL: Remember when I said genuine criminals shouldn't be in the Hall? This is who I was referring to. And apparently the BBWAA agrees with me given his decline in the most recent ballot. Sure there's still five more years for new info on the domestic abuse to come out, and when looking at raw stats he should be in the Hall, but right now, he should not get in based on what we have. It shouldn't happen to him, it shouldn't happen to freaking Trevor Bauer, it shouldn't happen to anybody who does something like that. 

BILLY WAGNER: The BBWAA seems to not know what to do with non-versatile players who weren't constantly in the game, and that includes relief pitchers. Wagner has had a similar rise to Rolen recently, but with two extra retired years on him and slightly less votes, he's in worse shape. If Wagner does get in, it'll be two or three years from now.

TODD HELTON: Helton will get in, but he's in a similar boat as Rolen and Wagner and won't be there for a while. Not that it's so bad in his case since he has a year on Rolen. 

GARY SHEFFIELD: While not as marred by steroids as Bonds and Clemens, he also hasn't posted nearly the number of votes for him to be considered a likely candidate. He's going to fall off in the next few years.

ANDRUW JONES: If it was just his Braves career, he would have been an early pick. But the BBWAA does have to factor in the Dodgers onwards, and those numbers did not help him out at all.

JEFF KENT AND MANNY RAMIREZ: They're way too far down. Kent's practically guaranteed to fall off next year, and Manny Ramirez is in the Bonds and Clemens camp, but with stats that are ""too low"" (compared to Bonds) for any chance of success.

SAMMY SOSA: Goodbye.

ANDY PETTITTE: Also in the Bonds and Clemens camp, along with stats non-comparable to Clemens.

THE RELATIVE NEWCOMERS: I don't see most of them sticking around as indicated by the votes. While Tim Hudson and Bobby Abreu have my vote for eventual VC candidacy, Mark Buehrle wasn't that much of a standout to begin with, and Torii Hunter's relatively lacking stats - not to mention his Latinophobic and homophobic comments - will keep him out as well.

CARL CRAWFORD: He doesn't really have the stats that would warrant a spot in the Hall.

PRINCE FIELDER AND RYAN HOWARD: The BBWAA is obsessed with longevity, and it's a luxury these two didn't have. They'll stick around for a few years and then fall to the wayside, as iconic as they are.

TIM LINCECUM: With how much he contributed to the Giants and his two Cy Young awards, you'd think his WAR would be way higher than it actually is. He'll stick around a bit but will fall off soon afterwards.

JUSTIN MORNEAU: A very popular figure that also did not have the benefit of longevity.

JOE NATHAN: Stats are very low despite a solid career, and that isn't attributable to his Tommy John surgery.

DAVID ORTIZ: Ortiz is the first of the two aforementioned players who will benefit from NOT being in the Bonds and Clemens club. Despite the proof of steroids being there for all to see, and the fact that the BBWAA is supposedly allergic to designated hitters, Ortiz is such a prominent and beloved figure in baseball that he will clear all the hurdles and be elected. If not this year, then in the years after that. 

JONATHAN PAPELBON: A relief pitcher with none of Wagner's stats. Will fall off.

JAKE PEAVY: Peavy has much better stats than most of the other pitchers here, and it will allow him to stick around longer. Longevity's going to be a thorn in his side as well, though in his case it won't matter quite as much.

A.J. Pierzynski: His reputation as an asshole, coupled with ""not quite there"" stats, will keep him out of the Hall.

Alex Rodriguez: Ooo boy again. A-Rod's the other player I think will benefit from not being in the Bonds and Clemens camp - even if he has a foot in. His rather public punishment compared to the other two seems like a death sentence on paper, but A-Rod's post-career has made him a surprisingly popular figure who isn't anywhere near as defensive as Bonds and Clemens. If A-Rod continues playing his cards right, he might actually get in. Bear in mind though, it's NOT happening this year. If it happens, it'll be in his eighth or ninth year on the ballot, given how extensive and publicized his situation has been, especially compared to someone like Ortiz.

JIMMY ROLLINS AND MARK TEIXEIRA: I think most would agree that these two are great players who could and should be in the Hall. It's just not happening this year; probably around Year 5 and 6 for them.",1637622112,False,False,1,2022 BBWAA Ballot and VC Predictions,1.0,0,7346,1313

I started watching the NFL about a decade ago and decided to be a fan of the NY Jets because Rex Ryan was funny and Revis was putting everybody on an island.  However since then the team has actually been quite bad and often times the laughing stock of the league.  I've had to deal with The Butt Fumble, Rex Ryan being into feet, revolving door of QB's, yadda yadda yadda.

Anyway.  I want to know what it feels like to cheer for a team that is competitive!  What teams have historically been great and which teams look like they have set themselves up for long term success? Is it the Yankees?  Cardinals?

Career pitching stats: 94 wins, 2.28ERA, 107CG, 17SHO, 488Ks, 1.16WHIP

Career highlight: the legend of calling his shot. Even though it may not have happened the legend of Babe Ruth is like an American tale and people to this day still know the story

Best season (1923 honorable mention 1927): .393/.545/.764, 205 hits, 41HRs, 130RBIs, 17SBs

Fun feat: The Babe once threw a combined no hitter after starting a game then getting tossed after one out. His reliever proceeded to pitch a no hitter following his ejection. 

Analysis: the Babe is legendary, an American folk tale, the first American celebrity. Everyone knew who he was. He played for the best team and was their best player so he drew a crowd. He leaned into the limelight and loved being a star. All this while his on field play was second to none. He was incredible doing things that we still hear about today.

Analysis: Griffey is no doubt an icon to the sport. If baseball had a Michael Jordan it’d be Griffey. He was flashy on and off the field, had the talent to boot and was kind to almost everyone he met. He possessed the sweetest swing in baseball and was a true 5 tool player. If you had the blessing of watching him you knew there was never a boring moment. Iconic is the word to describe him.

Career stats: 110.2WAR, .298/.421/.557, 536HRs, 153SBs, 2415 hits, 1509RBIs

Career highlight: out of many we can choose his memorable home run race with Roger Maris to try to beat the Babes record is one of the best

Best season (1952): .353/.464/.705, 188 hits, 52HR, 130RBIs, 10SBs

Fun feat: Mantle was a media darling so much that he was the one people wanted to break Babes single season record. He never did end up doing it but his teammate Roger Maris and him had a home run battle to rival McGwire vs Sosa to beat the Babes record

Analysis: Mickey is one of the GOATs and that cannot be denied. His speed was electric, his fielding was incredible and his ability to hit from both sides of the plate was something many players didn’t find success with at the time. He was a legend not only for the Yankees but in the sport with media talking about how far his home runs would go and how great he was and every bit of it was true. Injuries plagued him his whole career but to many there is none better than the Mick

Career stats: 81.3WAR, 3.19ERA, 5714Ks (record), 1.25WHIP, 6.6H/9

Career highlight: throwing 7 no hitters

Best season (1973): 21-16, 2.87ERA, 382Ks, 1.23WHIP, 6.6H/9, 10.6K/9

Fun feat: despite being arguably the greatest pitcher of all time Nolan never received the Cy Young award even losing it to his teammate Mike Scott

Analysis: the greatest strikeout pitcher to ever play the game and maybe the greatest pitcher to ever play. Nolan has everything you want in a pitchers career. The strikeouts, the longevity and the ERA he was a stud at everything well… except his control. Nolan threw one of the most electric fast balls ever with many saying it was faster than what was actually recorded in game. Ryan could sit down any batter on strikes early in his career and when he lost his strikeout potential he could still get you out in other ways. Ryan is one of the best players to ever play the game and besides his walk issue he’s the perfect pitcher

Hank Aaron RF, 1B (1954-1976)

career accolades: MVP, World Series Champion, 25x all star, 2x batting title, 3x gold glove, Hall of Fame

Career stats: 143.1WAR, .305/.374/.555, 3771 hits, 755HRs, 2297RBIs, 6856TBs

Career Highlight: breaking Babe Ruth’s home run record

Best season: 1959: .355 (career high) 223 hits (career high), 46 doubles (career high), .401OBP, .636SLG, 123RBIs, 39HRs

Small analysis: Hank Aaron while boasting the accolade of home run king beating Babe Ruth’s record does not see that as his biggest accomplishment. Aaron says I’m his autobiography that he is proudest about his career .305avg and 3000+ hits. Aaron is one of the most consistent players to ever play the game. Where Bonds had monster seasons hitting home runs* in his career, Hank broke Babes record by consistently hitting home runs throughout his 22 year career.

Career accolades: 2x MVP, 2x Triple Crown, 19x all star, 6x all star, Hall of Fame

Career stats: 122.1WAR, .344/.482/.634, 521HRs, 2654 hits, 1839RBIs, 4884 total bases

Career highlights: last major league player to hit .400 and holds the record for career OBP at .482

Best season: 1941: .406/.553/.735, 185 hits, 37HRs, 120RBIs

Fun feat: Ted Williams was hitting .3995 going into the final day of the season in 1941 but there was debate since it wasn’t technically .400. The Boston star was asked if he wanted to sit out but to stop any doubt that he hit .400 he played both games going 6-8 and finishing the season hitting .406

Analysis: Teddy ballgame. What is there to say. A hitter that commanded so much respect at the plate if he wouldn’t swing at a pitch the umpires would call it a ball because they knew he had that good of an eye they gave it to him. He was feared at the plate so much that people put him with Babe Ruth on the Mount Rushmore of hitters. Ted hit the ball better than many that played the game even writing the book “The Science of Hitting” which many players said helped them understand how to be a better hitter. If there were any downside to his game it was his fielding capability but his bat made up for any mistake in the field.

Best season (2005): 1.38ERA, 43-47 in saves, 80Ks

Fun feat: Rivera has more saves then fellow HoFers Rollie Fingers and Goose Gossage combined

Analysis: for many positions you can make an argument for different players as the greatest but when it comes to the greatest closer ever you can only have one name. Rivera is the best closer of all time while only throwing one pitch. His cutter was a nightmare for opposing hitters and any time he came in you could stop watching cause the game was over but you’d miss one of the best pitchers ever.

Best season (1922): .401/.459/.722, 250 hits, 42HRs, 152RBIs

Fun feat: Hornsby is the only player to win the NL Triple Crown twice

Analysis: Roger is the Ty Cobb of the NL if there ever was one the difference is Hornsby had the pop that Cobb lacked in his bat. A man that was obsessed with hitting he made it his goal to be the best hitter every season he could be. He even refused to read newspapers or go out so he could focus on hitting and this worked as Hornsby owns the highest single season batting average outside the dead ball era. He was a solid fielder at second as well but at the plate he excelled.

Best season (1927): .373/.474/.765, 218 hits, 47HR, 173RBIs, 52 doubles

Fun fact: Lou was the first athlete to appear on a box of wheaties 

Analysis: Lou was the robin to the Babes Batman who blossomed into the Nightwing of the team.

Best season (1991): 11.5WAR (most by a SS), .323/.374/.567, 210 hits, 34HRs, 114RBIs

Fun feat: there is a conspiracy that the orioles faked an electrical issue so Cal could keep his game streak alive

Analysis: Cal may not have been one of the most consistent hitters to play the game but his longevity of playing and his glove at short made him a valuable player. Cal was reliable to play and play well. He was never a liability and his best years at the plate made him one of the best SS of all time.

I am relatively new to watching MLB, generally being an NFL fan, and I have a few questions regarding the draft because I had heard during a World Series game that one of the pitchers was a 19th-round pick. 

1) Why are there so many rounds in the MLB draft? Given that it has fewer teams and fewer starting players than the NFL, what's the reason for this? 

2) What positions generally go first in the MLB draft and why?

3) Since there are MLB and then the minor leagues, do drafted players automatically go to MLB teams and are immediate starters?

4) If players didn't play in the college sytems, are they free to sign with any team or would they also have to go through the draft? 

5) How popular is the draft among MLB fans? Do MLB fans follow college baseball and anticipate the draft as rabidly as NFL fans? 

6) What other things are there that the average MLB viewer should know about the draft?",1636614139,False,False,1,Questions on MLB draft,1.0,3,918,169

Career accolades: MVP, ROTY, 7x all star, World Series champion, batting title, Hall of Fame

Career stats: 63.9WAR, .313/.410/.477, 1563 hits, 200SBs, 141HRs, 761RBIs

Career highlight: breaking the color barrier in professional sports and his biggest in game moment. Stealing home in the World Series

Best season (1949): .342/.432/.528, 203 hits, 16HRs, 124RBIs, 37SBs

Fun feat: Jackie broke the color barrier in major league sports in 1947 which is the most fun feat a player could do literally changing history

Analysis: Jackie is a great player, there are some under the assumption that he was overrated but his stats are great especially in his prime he was a spectacle to watch playing the game quickly with his steal of home being a moment in history you still show people today. He was a player good enough to play against players who hated him and to succeed with all the pressure put on him it shows the true value Jackie brought to the sport

vs

Nolan Ryan SP (1966-1993)

Career accolades: 8x all star, World Series champion, 2x ERA Title, Hall of Fame

Career stats: 81.3WAR, 3.19ERA, 5714Ks (record), 1.25WHIP, 6.6H/9

Career highlight: throwing 7 no hitters

Best season (1973): 21-16, 2.87ERA, 382Ks, 1.23WHIP, 6.6H/9, 10.6K/9

Fun feat: despite being arguably the greatest pitcher of all time Nolan never received the Cy Young award even losing it to his teammate Mike Scott

Analysis: the greatest strikeout pitcher to ever play the game and maybe the greatest pitcher to ever play. Nolan has everything you want in a pitchers career. The strikeouts, the longevity and the ERA he was a stud at everything well… except his control. Nolan threw one of the most electric fast balls ever with many saying it was faster than what was actually recorded in game. Ryan could sit down any batter on strikes early in his career and when he lost his strikeout potential he could still get you out in other ways. Ryan is one of the best players to ever play the game and besides his walk issue he’s the perfect pitcher

Career stats: 110.2WAR, .298/.421/.557, 536HRs, 153SBs, 2415 hits, 1509RBIs

Career highlight: out of many we can choose his memorable home run race with Roger Maris to try to beat the Babes record is one of the best

Best season (1952): .353/.464/.705, 188 hits, 52HR, 130RBIs, 10SBs

Fun feat: Mantle was a media darling so much that he was the one people wanted to break Babes single season record. He never did end up doing it but his teammate Roger Maris and him had a home run battle to rival McGwire vs Sosa to beat the Babes record

Analysis: Mickey is one of the GOATs and that cannot be denied. His speed was electric, his fielding was incredible and his ability to hit from both sides of the plate was something many players didn’t find success with at the time. He was a legend not only for the Yankees but in the sport with media talking about how far his home runs would go and how great he was and every bit of it was true. Injuries plagued him his whole career but to many there is none better than the Mick

Best season (1911): .419/.466/.620, 248 hits, 127RBIs, 83SBs. 

Fun feats: Lead every offensive stat in the 1911 season besides home runs

Analysis: Ty Cobb is the start of the hard nose no nonsense player. A man who was said to fight fans and players a like he had the talent to earn him this respect as well. A man with the speed, contact and ability to hit the ball in the gap he was a threat all the time. He was a player that commanded respect and that was shown when he was the first man voted into the MLB Hall of Fame.

He also received many of his major awards in his great 2012 season in which he won his MVP, HA award, SS, and batting title. But other than that year all he has is 3 SS and 1 GG for individual awards.

**TRANSITIONS:**

Late 2021/Early 2022:

At the 11-hour, the Oakland Athletics, Oakland City Council along with Alameda County work together to come to an agreement on financing and infrastructure and Howard Terminal gets built.

&amp;#x200B;

2022:

The Cleveland Indians become the Cleveland Guardians.

The Universal DH and new salary floor is agreed upon between the owners and MLBPA in exchange for a 12-team postseason with 6 teams in each league qualifying.

&amp;#x200B;

2028:

After the Tampa Bay Rays split season proposal to split time between Tampa and Montreal fails, Stu Stenberg gets fed up and sells the Tampa Bay Rays entirely to Stephen Bronfman. The teams is then moved full-time to Montreal, QC and rebranded as the Montreal Expos.

&amp;#x200B;

The 2 Expansion Teams:

Nashville Stars - (Music City Baseball group ownership)

Portland Beavers - (Portland Diamond Project Group ownership)

&amp;#x200B;

**THE NEW REALIGNMENT FOR 2028:**

&amp;#x200B;

With 32 teams, the MLB would likely want 8 4-team divisions in realignment.

&amp;#x200B;

**AMERICAN LEAGUE**

2028:

In another new CBA, MLBPA, the MLB and owners would agree to have the regular season reduced when the league is expanded. Also a new TV deal will be reached. The number they will end of settling on is 154 games. By doing this, each team would be guaranteed at least 1 day of a week. They would also agree that the players would not have to take a pay cut for having reduced the schedule to 154 games.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE NEW REGULAR SEASON SCHEDULE FORMULA:**

&amp;#x200B;

**Divisional Play:**

18 games each vs. all 3 divisional opponents = 54 games

(Three 3-Game Series Home and Three 3-Game Series Away vs. each team)

&amp;#x200B;

**Non Divisional Play Within League:**

6 games each vs. all 12 non-divisional opponents within league = 72 games

(One 3-Game Series Home and One 3-Game Series Away vs each team)

&amp;#x200B;

**Interleague Play:**

6 games each vs. all 4 interleague opponents from 1 assigned interleague division = 24 games

(One 3-Game Series Home and One 3-Game Series Away vs each team)

Assigned interleague divisions will rotate annually (4-year cycle). All 4 teams in a division would be assigned the same interleague division.

&amp;#x200B;

4 games vs. interleague ""natural"" rival = 4 games

(One 2-Game Series Home and One 2-Game Series Away).

Would be play on Thursday-Sunday directly after the All-Star break in Mid-July. Thursday and Friday at one ballpark and then Saturday and Sunday at the opposite ballpark.

(Mets-Yankees, Cubs-White Sox, Angels-Dodgers, Athletics-Giants, etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

**54 games + 72 games + 24 games + 4 games = 154-game regular season**

&amp;#x200B;

**THE EXPANDED POSTSEASON:**

&amp;#x200B;

In the new CBA after expansion, 12 teams (6 in each league) would qualify for the postseason.

The 4 division winners plus 2 wild cards would qualify for the postseason.

The 4 division winners would be seeded 1-4 by record. The 2 wild-cards would be seeded 5-6 by record.

&amp;#x200B;

**League Wild card Series (ALWCS &amp; NLWCS):**

The 1 and 2 seeded division winners would get a bye from this round. The 3 and 4 seeded division winners would battle against the 5 and 6 seeded wild-cards. This round would be a best of 3 series with all games in the series being hosted by the division winners. The wild cards would get no home games for this round. (3 seed vs. 6 seed) and (4 seed vs 5 seed).

&amp;#x200B;

**League Divisional Series (ALDS &amp; NLDS):**

(1 seed vs. wild card round winner with worst regular season record)

(2 seed vs. other wild card round winner)

Best of 5 Series (2-2-1 format).

&amp;#x200B;

**League Championship Series (ALCS &amp; NLCS):**

As normal. Best of 7 Series (2-3-2 format).

&amp;#x200B;

Career stats: 122.1WAR, .344/.482/.634, 521HRs, 2654 hits, 1839RBIs, 4884 total bases

Career highlights: last major league player to hit .400 and holds the record for career OBP at .482

Best season: 1941: .406/.553/.735, 185 hits, 37HRs, 120RBIs

Fun feat: Ted Williams was hitting .3995 going into the final day of the season in 1941 but there was debate since it wasn’t technically .400. The Boston star was asked if he wanted to sit out but to stop any doubt that he hit .400 he played both games going 6-8 and finishing the season hitting .406

Analysis: Teddy ballgame. What is there to say. A hitter that commanded so much respect at the plate if he wouldn’t swing at a pitch the umpires would call it a ball because they knew he had that good of an eye they gave it to him. He was feared at the plate so much that people put him with Babe Ruth on the Mount Rushmore of hitters. Ted hit the ball better than many that played the game even writing the book “The Science of Hitting” which many players said helped them understand how to be a better hitter. If there were any downside to his game it was his fielding capability but his bat made up for any mistake in the field. 

vs

Ichiro RF (2001-2019)

Career stats: 60WAR, .311/.355/.402, 3089 hits, 117HRs, 780RBIs, 509SBs, 3994TBs

Career highlight: Having the most hits in baseball history when combining his stats from MLB and NPB (Japan)

Best season (2001): .350/.381/.457, 242 hits, 8HRs, 56SBs, 69RBIs, MVP (honorable mention to 2004 which may be his greatest individual season but Ichiros accolades and impact on the mariners in ‘01 puts this season on top)

Fun feat: Ichiro became the second player ever to win MVP as a rookie

Analysis: Ichiro is one of the most talented players to step on the field boasting the hitting ability of Pete Rose with plus talent in all aspects of the game even boasting he could hit 40 home runs but felt getting on base helped his team more. He is the baseball home run king when combining his hits in Japan and America he has more hits than Pete Rose and was a threat in two major leagues. Ichiro was fun to not only watch but to be around for his teammates having a great personality and enjoying every moment of the game.

Career stats: 69.2WAR, .338/.388/.459, 3141 hits, 135HRs, 1138RBIs, 319SBs, 543 doubles, 85 triples

Career Highlight: nearly achieving a .400 batting average before the lockout ended the season. 

Best season: 1987: .370/.447/.511, 218 hits, 56SBs. Honorable mention to the strike shortened season of ‘94 where Gwynn ended with a batting average of .397

Analysis: In a time where the league started moving toward power and the long ball Gwynn showed up and did what he did best. Hit. Gwynn was a prolific contact hitter almost hitting .400 where he would have been the first to do it since Ted Williams. His hitting prowess almost guaranteed him to be a threat at the plate with his speed to cause chaos on the base baths Gwynn succeeded and is an epitome of a great lead off hitter. Another thing Gwynn had to boast was his ability to play the field. Gwynn was a 5x gold glover and with his speed could chase down any ball into the gap.

Small analysis: Hank Aaron while boasting the accolade of home run king beating Babe Ruth’s record does not see that as his biggest accomplishment. Aaron says I’m his autobiography that he is proudest about his career .305avg and 3000+ hits. Aaron is one of the most consistent players to ever play the game.

Career accolades: Hall of Fame, MVP, 2x all star, 7x World Series champion, batting title, ERA title

Career hitting stats: 183.1WAR, .342/.474/.690 (SLG record), 2873 hits, 714HRs, 2214RBIs, 123SBs

Career pitching stats: 94 wins, 2.28ERA, 107CG, 17SHO, 488Ks, 1.16WHIP

Career highlight: the legend of calling his shot. Even though it may not have happened the legend of Babe Ruth is like an American tale and people to this day still know the story

Best season (1923 honorable mention 1927): .393/.545/.764, 205 hits, 41HRs, 130RBIs, 17SBs

Fun feat: The Babe once threw a combined no hitter after starting a game then getting tossed after one out. His reliever proceeded to pitch a no hitter following his ejection. 

Analysis: the Babe is legendary, an American folk tale, the first American celebrity. Everyone knew who he was. He played for the best team and was their best player so he drew a crowd. He leaned into the limelight and loved being a star. All this while his on field play was second to none. He was incredible doing things that we still hear about today. There’s a reason every player gets compared to him because there’s none other like the Babe

vs

Mike Trout CF (2011-)

Career accolades: 3x MVP, ROTY, 9x all star, 8x silver slugger, 2x AS MVP

Career stats (as of 2021): 76.1WAR, .305/.419/.583, 1419 hits, 310HRs, 816RBIs, 203SBs

Career highlight: being the first player to hit 30HRs, steal 45 bases and scoring 125 runs in one season

Best season (2018): .312/.460/.628, 147 hits, 39HRs, 24SBs, 79RBIs

Fun feat: Mike Trout was banned from the milk tower carnival game for winning to much

Analysis: take the talent of Griffey and translate it to today and you have trout. An exciting player since day one he has dazzled us since his entry into the league in ‘11. When he’s injured you feel the effects on the game because he is that fun to watch. Trout is a 5 tool player with one of the best personalities in sports and is undoubtedly the best player playing currently.

Career stats: 139.2WAR, 3.12ERA, 4672Ks, 1.17WHIP, 7.7H/9, 2.9BB/9, 8.6K/9

Career highlight: breaking the single game strikeout record… and then doing it again recording 20 strikeouts

Best season (1990): 21-6, 1.93ERA, 209Ks, 1.08WHIP

Fun feat: Clemens won the Cy Young in back to back years twice while winning the MVP in that span

Analysis: Clemens has one of the best pitching careers one can want. The longevity and success of his career is rarely matched by most players winning his first Cy Young in 1986 at the age of 23 while winning his 7th and final Cy Young at 41 in 2004. Clemens had the presence on the mound with the intimidation factor to match.

Career stats: 95.9WAR, .276/.340/.447, 3184 hits, 431HRs, 1695RBIs, 5186TBs

Career highlight: breaking Lou Gehrigs consecutive game streak

Best season (1991): 11.5WAR (most by a SS), .323/.374/.567, 210 hits, 34HRs, 114RBIs

Fun feat: there is a conspiracy that the orioles faked an electrical issue so Cal could keep his game streak alive

Analysis: Cal may not have been one of the most consistent hitters to play the game but his longevity of playing and his glove at short made him a valuable player. Cal was reliable to play and play well. He was never a liability and his best years at the plate made him one of the best SS of all time.

Career stats: 128.7WAR, .331/.417/.559, 3630 hits, 475HRs, 1951RBIs 

Career highlight: hitting 5 home runs in a doubleheader

Best season (1948): .376/.450/.702, 230 hits, 39HRs, 131RBIs (came within a home run of the triple crown)

Fun feat: Musial has the same number of career hits at home and on the road

Analysis: One of the best hitters to ever swing the bat Stan was the player that future major leaguers looked up too. He was the Ted Williams of the NL with a great presence at the plate while having serviceable defense in the field. 

vs

Lou Gehrig 1B (1923-1939)

Career accolades: 2x MVP, Triple Crown, 7x all star, 6x World Series champion, batting title, Hall of Fame

Career stats: 113.7WAR, .340/.447/.632, 2721 hits, 493HR, 1995RBIs, 5060TBs, 102SBs

Career highlight: Hitting 4 home runs in a single game

Best season (1927): .373/.474/.765, 218 hits, 47HR, 173RBIs, 52 doubles

Fun fact: Lou was the first athlete to appear on a box of wheaties 

Analysis: Lou was the robin to the Babes Batman who blossomed into the Nightwing of the team. One of the men that paved the way for the hard hitting first baseman he batted like only few in the league at the time. Gehrig was a great hitter with good defense at first and a cornerstone for the Yankees dynasty and a legend for more than just his on field skills

Career highlight: throwing 7 no hitters

Best season (1973): 21-16, 2.87ERA, 382Ks, 1.23WHIP, 6.6H/9, 10.6K/9

Fun feat: despite being arguably the greatest pitcher of all time Nolan never received the Cy Young award even losing it to his teammate Mike Scott

Analysis: the greatest strikeout pitcher to ever play the game and maybe the greatest pitcher to ever play. Nolan has everything you want in a pitchers career. The strikeouts, the longevity and the ERA he was a stud at everything well… except his control. Nolan threw one of the most electric fast balls ever with many saying it was faster than what was actually recorded in game. Ryan could sit down any batter on strikes early in his career and when he lost his strikeout potential he could still get you out in other ways. Ryan is one of the best players to ever play the game and besides his walk issue he’s the perfect pitcher

vs

Career accolades: MVP, ROTY, 17x all star, 3x World Series Champion, 2x gold glove, Silver Slugger, World Series MVP, 3x Batting Title

Career stats: 79.6WAR, .303/.375/.409, 4256 hits, 160HRs, 198SBs, 1314RBIs

Career highlight: breaking Ty Cobb’s hit record

Best season (1973): .338/.401/.437, 230 hits, 5HRs, 64RBIs, 10SBs

Fun feat: Rose is the only player in MLB history to play 500 games at 5 different positions. Those being 1B, 2B, 3B, LF and RF

Analysis: Pete Rose is like if you took Ty Cobb and placed him in the 60-80s. He was a hitters hitter and could see the ball like no one at the time. Charlie Hustle worked his butt off day in and day out as he perfected his hitting mechanics and obsessed with eclipsing Cobbs record. He was valuable at multiple positions while knowing the ins and outs of the game so well he become a manager. Pete was the real deal you can bet on that.

Best season (1901): 33-10, 1.62ERA, 38CG, 5SHO, 158Ks

Fun feat: contrary to todays warmup methods and prep to start Cy said he never stretched and would warm up just 3 minutes before the game. 

Analysis: Cy pitched in a time where hitting was not a strong suit for players in the majors but that does not take away his feats. He would pitch complete games and be good to go 130+ pitches deep into games. He had the longevity to mow down batters and would finish most games he started. What holds Cy back is the age he played in but his success cannot be argued. 

vs

Jackie Robinson 2B, 3B, 1B (1945-1956)

Career stats: 63.9WAR, .313/.410/.477, 1563 hits, 200SBs, 141HRs, 761RBIs

Career highlight: breaking the color barrier in professional sports and his biggest in game moment. Stealing home in the World Series

Best season (1949): .342/.432/.528, 203 hits, 16HRs, 124RBIs, 37SBs

Fun feat: Jackie broke the color barrier in major league sports in 1947 which is the most fun feat a player could do literally changing history

Analysis: Jackie is a great player, there are some under the assumption that he was overrated but his stats are great especially in his prime he was a spectacle to watch playing the game quickly with his steal of home being a moment in history you still show people today. He was a player good enough to play against players who hated him and to succeed with all the pressure put on him it shows the true value Jackie brought to the sport

Fun feats: Lead every offensive stat in the 1911 season besides home runs

Analysis: Ty Cobb is the start of the hard nose no nonsense player. A man who was said to fight fans and players a like he had the talent to earn him this respect as well. A man with the speed, contact and ability to hit the ball in the gap he was a threat all the time. He was a player that commanded respect and that was shown when he was the first man voted into the MLB Hall of Fame.

Career accolades: Cy Young, 17x all star, World Series champion, 3x ERA title

Fun feat: Spahn is the most winning left handed pitcher for his career

Analysis: Spahn was a pinnacle of pitching in the 50s being on the top of his game he valued wins more than any stat. He would pride himself in his ability to win. Spahn was a pitcher that would trip up many hitters possibly a 50s Greg Maddux forcing batters to hit ground balls instead of blowing balls by them

Career stats: 111.2WAR, .279/.401/.419, 3055 hits, 297HR, 1406SBs, 2295 runs, 1115RBIs

Career highlight: eclipsing Lou Brock single season stolen base record and then going on to break his career stolen base record solidifying his record as near unbreakable

Best season: Rickey had many strong seasons breaking the single season steal record in 1982 but his best overall season may be 1985: .314/.419/.516, 172 hits, 24HRs, 72RBIs, 80SBs

Fun feat: Rickey’s (1st) distance between him and Lou Brock (2nd) for career steals is the same as Brock and Jimmy Rollins (47th)

Analysis: When people think of Rickey everyone thinks of his speed and think that is what he is all about but Rickey was a great player at the plate. In his time he was only 2nd to Barry Bonds in walks through that span And was a strong presence at the plate hitting .300 multiple times in his career. His speed gave him great range in the OF and his talents to find the gaps and pop a homer every so often made him a player who you look back and watch while looking at his stats and truly know we will never see a player like him again. 

vs

Mickey Mantle CF, 1B (1951-1968)

Career accolades: 3x MVP, Triple Crown, 20x all star, 7x World Series champion, Gold Glove, Batting Title, Hall of Fame

Career stats: 110.2WAR, .298/.421/.557, 536HRs, 153SBs, 2415 hits, 1509RBIs

Career highlight: out of many we can choose his memorable home run race with Roger Maris to try to beat the Babes record is one of the best

Best season (1952): .353/.464/.705, 188 hits, 52HR, 130RBIs, 10SBs

Fun feat: Mantle was a media darling so much that he was the one people wanted to break Babes single season record. He never did end up doing it but his teammate Roger Maris and him had a home run battle to rival McGwire vs Sosa to beat the Babes record

Analysis: Mickey is one of the GOATs and that cannot be denied. His speed was electric, his fielding was incredible and his ability to hit from both sides of the plate was something many players didn’t find success with at the time. He was a legend not only for the Yankees but in the sport with media talking about how far his home runs would go and how great he was and every bit of it was true. Injuries plagued him his whole career but to many there is none better than the Mick

In full disclosure, I never watched a single inning of the 2020 “season” due to the Covid nonsense…it just wasn’t real baseball IMO!

So now in the 2021 season, I’m seeing two particular changes that are really screwing up a lot of games:

1 - starting a runner at 2nd in extra innings, and

2 - playing only 7 innings in a double header “complete game”!

Extra inning games have a completely different strategy this year…and it just should not be tolerated that a team can “score a run” on nothing more than a base hit!

7 inning games? Seriously? Maybe due to Covid or some other EXCEPTIONAL reason, but not just because it’s a double header!

MLB doesn’t even schedule double headers any more…we only see them occasionally to make up postponed games!

These are professional players making more money in a season than I will in my lifetime! I think the “little fellas” can handle actually playing two regulation games on occasion when it is necessary!

How did the game get so wimpy? A reliever comes in and throws 1 inning and then supposedly can’t “work again” for a day or two?

Even the broadcasters these days make it seem like it has been such a “long game” if it lasts 3.5 or 4 hours!

There was this MLB pitcher named Rick Honeycutt who in 1980 thought he could get away with cheating by taping a thumbtack on his finger to try to scuff the ball and hopefully not get caught. The method didn't work the way he intended as the Umpires did notice marks on the ball and Honeycutt (with the ironic last name) ended up cutting his forehead when he accidentally rubbed it with the hand that had the thumbtack resulting in bleeding. He was ejected and suspended for ten games. 

It's very hard to try to scuff the ball and not get noticed because the Umpires check every single ball throughout the game and if they suspect something, they will immediately approach the pitcher to examine any illegal substance on the pitcher's body. It also doesn't help that the pitcher is constantly being watched on camera and it wouldn't take long for the opponent's manager to notice something on the footage and all he has to do is tell the umpires to examine the pitcher if he suspects something against the rules is happening. 

I got to give credit to Honeycutt for trying something different, but it clearly didn't work the way he intended.

2022: 

Cleveland Indians name change to Cleveland Guardians

The Universal DH is implemented.  


2024:

After the Howard Terminal bid falls through due to disagreements between the team and the city over financing, Oakland Athletics would relocate to Las Vegas, NV after lease runs out on Oakland Coliseum. However, they chose to keep there team name.

2028:

After, the irrational 2-city plan to split the Tampa Bay Rays between Montreal and Tampa Bay fails, Stu Stenberg would get fed up and sell the team to John Loar and the Music City Baseball group. The team is then relocated to Nashville, TN and rebranded as the Nashville Stars. 

&amp;#x200B;

EXPANSION:

The 2 expansion teams chosen would be: 

Charlotte Cougars   
(fastest growing area in US) - Added to National League

Portland Beavers   
(Portland Diamond Project Group) - Added to American League

&amp;#x200B;

LEAGUE SWITCHES:

Since, the DH would become universal league switching wouldn't be a big issue.

However, the MLB would probably still like to keep as many rivalries as possible so they most likely would want to stick with a simple realignment.

As part of their rebranding the Nashville Stars (the then formerly Tampa Bay Rays) would switch over to National League.

In return, the Colorado Rockies would swap over the American League to make the geography work.

&amp;#x200B;

THE NEW REALIGNMENT FOR 2028:

With 32 teams, the MLB would likely want 8 4-team division in realignment.

2028:

Since 2020, there has been talk of the MLB and the owners pushing to have a 14-team postseason with 7 teams in league qualifying. After expansion, with a new CBA, I strongly feel as though this will become a reality.

Also likely to happen in a new CBA, MLBPA, the MLB and owners would agree to have the regular season reduced as a tradeoff for the expanded postseason. The number they will end of settling on is 156 games. By doing this, each team would be guaranteed at least 1 day of a week. They would also agree that the players would not have to take a pay cut for having reduced the schedule to 156 games.

&amp;#x200B;

THE NEW REGULAR SEASON FORMULA:  


Divisional Play:

12 games each vs. all 3 divisional opponents = 36 games

(Two 3-Game Series Home and Two 3-Game Series Away)  


Non Divisional Play Within League:

6 games each vs. all 12 non-divisional opponents within league = 72 games

(One 3-Game Series Home and One 3-Game Series Away)

  
Interleague Play:

3 games each vs. all 16 interleague opponents = 48 games

(One 3-Game Series Home vs. 8 teams \[2 from each division\])  
(One 3-Game Series Away vs. 8 teams \[2 from each division\])  
The site of each interleague matchup would alternate each year.  


36 games + 72 games + 48 games = 156-game regular season  


Since, the DH would be universal, I feel as though the MLB would probably like to have each team face one another in at least one series per year and add more variety to each team schedule.  


  
THE EXPANDED POSTSEASON:  


In the new CBA after expansion, 14 teams (7 in each league) would qualify for the postseason.

The 4 division winners plus 3 wild cards would qualify for the postseason.

The 4 division winners would be seeded 1-4 by record. The 3 wild-cards would be seeded 5-7 by record.

  
League Wild card Series (ALWCS &amp; NLWCS):

The top seeded division winner would get a bye from this round. The 2, 3 and 4 seeded division winners would battle against the 5, 6 and 7 seeded wild-cards. This round would be a best of 3 series with all games in the series being hosted by the division winners. The wild cards would get no home games for this round. (2 vs. 7), (3 vs. 6) and (4 vs 5).  


League Divisional Series (ALDS &amp; NLDS):

(1 seed vs. Wild card round winner with worst regular season record),  
(The remaining 2 wild card round winners vs. each other)  
Best of 5 Series (2-2-1 format).  


League Championship Series (ALCS &amp; NLCS):

Dude got a 2-year, $16MM contract from the Rangers in 2019 because he pitched a string of 11 decent games in 2019 for the Brewers: 2.45 ERA, 1.11 WHIP in 58 innings (4.42 FIP). I wonder if they just didn't bother to look at his 8 prior seasons: 5.28 ERA, 1.46 ERA in 768 innings.

About the only consistent positive trait he has as a pitcher is control: 3.1 BB/9 career. Though, that isn't so great when you consider his 10 hits allowed per 9 innings. Not to mention, his 8.4% career swinging strike rate is terrible.

Martin Perez is another: since 2013, when he placed 6th in Rookie of the Year ballots, he's posted a 4.82 ERA and 1.50 WHIP in 929 innings.

As the title states I'm a new fan to the MLB this year. I pretty much watch all sports such as Soccer (United &amp; PSG), GAA (Wexford), NFL (Cheifs) and the NBA. I've a few questions about the MLB just from my eyes alone.

I currently support the Boston RedSox due to the fact it's the most closely linked team to Ireland (where I'm from) but I'm also interested in other teams such as the Angels and Cubs. I've seen online for people to say not to support the Red Sox due to their fanbase and racism etc, can someone explain this a bit more to me what this statement is about?

Why are the ballparks never full? When I watch my other sports such as GAA and soccer the stadiums are at full capacity, but when I watch the MLB the stadiums don't seem to be anywhere near full.

What are the biggest rivalries in MLB? Apart from the Red Sox and Yankees.

Does MLB work the same way as NFL with the drafting as the worst team that year gets first pick next year or is it more complex than that?

Is there websites to buy jerseys and apparel outside of the USA? Cause at the moment from the MLB store it'll cost me another 50€ to deliver it to Ireland and will take like two weeks...",1628772254,False,False,1,New fan to MLB (from outside of the USA) with some questions,1.0,11,1191,225

I like it because, not only does it speed up the usual 3-4 hour game that is already going to extras.. but also adds some extra gameplanning as to substitution of the base-runner and other things.

And for that for me is either Tatis Jr or Guerrero Jr, as the has of the league.

\-Games are too long

\-it's stars are players the american people can't relate to.

\-it's more local than national

\-it was more fun when everybody was juiced up

\-Doesn't know how to promote its players.

&amp;#x200B;

All somewhat valid arguments, even though I don't completely agree with all of them. I feel like a big reason MLB struggles is due to lack of dynasties. MLB doesn't usually have dynasties, at least not in the past 20 years. The closest thing to a dynasty in MLB since 2001 are the Giants. The red sox are another team but I don't consider them a dynasty because only the 2004 and 2007 teams had a good amount of  players on both teams. The other teams felt like a completely different group of people. Also when these teams win, MLB doesn't know how to make them the bad buy. Since 2001 NBA has had several dynasties (Lakers twice, Spurs, Heat, Warriors) and each team had a huge fan base that wanted them to win but also as big of a fan that wanted to see them lose (maybe not the spurs). Other than the Yankees, baseball doesn't really have that, at least not in the past 20 years. It's nice to see the Yankees lose but the Yankees not winning has somewhat been bad for baseball because it has not given the nation a desire to watch them lose.

0,SonnyDonny,"A “Kris Bryant for JD Davis and prospects” trade is the most ass backwards thing I’ve ever heard. The Mets’ primary struggles right now revolve around offense, and it may come as a shock to a lot of people pushing for the trade, but Kris Bryant and JD Davis are comparable offensively. Actually, comparable is putting it lightly, they’re bordering on identical. Kris Bryant made an All-Star game in 2019 with an OPS+ of 133, and JD Davis is constantly in trade talks after posting an OPS+ of 133 in the same exact season. Both JD and Bryant struggled in the covid shortened season, but even then JD outperformed him on a rate basis. That’s without even mentioning the absolute tear JD was on prior to his injury. The offense needs a shot in the arm, so trading a guy who’s batting .390 right now with an OPS+ north of 200 who was absolutely raking in his rehab assignments for a bordering on identical (and some could argue worse) offensive player that costs 10 times as much is apparently the only solution. If the Mets trade JD we will regret it for the foreseeable future, and that’s not even thinking about the prospects we’d lose in the deal. Let’s go over the luxury tax to completely stagnate offensively because Bryant has some brand recognition.

1,joe93133,"Lifelong baseball fan (40+ years). Somehow I've never been to Fenway, but a last-minute trip is bringing me to Boston and I should be attending my first game(s) next Tuesday and/or Wednesday (June 14-15).

Couple questions:

1. What's the best way to get single tickets? For the game(s) next Tuesday and Wednesday against Oakland, should I buy in advance or am I likely to find deals, or at least face-value prices, if I buy on game day? Since it will be my first visit, I'm hoping to wander around the ballpark, so not looking to break the bank on a seat I'll probably only use for half the game.

2. Do the Green Monster standing-room tickets allow access to the rest of Fenway, or only to the Monster via one particular gate? The Monster seems like an interesting experience, but not if I couldn't see the rest of Fenway. (I might do the tour, if I have time.)

Thanks very much.",1654885686,False,False,1,Green Monster standing-room seats,1.0,0,882,157

1,lordbloodstar,"Amazingly after the wild ride that we have had over the last few weeks, the Sox find themselves in the playoff hunt with the final wild card spot. 

Over the next 12 games, the Sox play 9 of them against sub .500 teams. The next team in the rankings, the Jays, have a *slightly* harder schedule going 8 of 12 against sub .500 teams. The catch is that from the 17th through July 3rd, they will be playing playoff bound teams including a series in Toronto against the Sox. 

Our next goal should be to jump over them by July 3rd when we are playing against the Cubs. 

Yes, after the cubs, its a brutal schedule for the whole month of July, which is why its important to get a nice little bump. Its a difference of 4 games but it would be huge.",1654865900,False,False,1,Next Goal: Move up a spot for the wild card teams,1.0,0,742,144

1,solidarity47,"Assuming Boston are buyers at the trade deadline (just under two months from now), what do they need to push deep? I'd say they definitely need a closer and a first baseman. First base is literally the cheapest position to find production at, it makes no sense to not try and upgrade there.

I don't think we need a wholesale refresh of the bullpen. When Sale and Paxton come back, Whitlock will probably be shifted to the bullpen full time. Plus we have a lot of lights out starters at AAA who might be able to contribute in relief late in the season. So just the closer for me. Could always pick up an extra starter for depth, assuming one of the guys we already have starts to revert to the mean.

I also wouldn't mind a corner outfielder.

We should go for Hosmer or Bell at first base. I don't think we'd be able to get Bell but we should be able to get Hosmer plus a few prospects from the Padres for next to nothing. They're keen to shift his contract but I honestly don't think it's that bad $13m for another three years. He's also playing well so far, 120 OPS+ and he's a slightly above average defender.

For a closer, I think we should target David Bednar or Jhoan Duran but they could be expensive.

And at corner, Ian Happ might be worth a look. Could also be expensive though.

1,idsoxfan,"So I went down a rabbit hole today concerning Dwight Evans and have come out the other side pretty pissed off that he isn't in the Hall of Fame. I've been pissed about Luis Tiant for years as well.

Here's a quick rundown of Dewey's stats:

.272/.370/.470, 120 OPS+, 129 WRC+, 65.1 WAR, 483 2B, 385 HR, 1391 BB, 1384 RBI

Plus:
8 Gold Gloves
2 Silver Sluggers
3 All-Star appearances
5 Top-10 MVP voting finishes

Personally, that spells Hall of Famer, but since he played in an era ('72-'91) where batting average was king and advanced stats weren't even a concept, it was not the consensus view. Dewey fell off the ballot after 3 years. 

He will be a candidate on this years Contemporary Baseball Era committee ballot.

Barry Bonds, Roger Clemens, and Curt Schilling will all be eligible to be on the same ballot.

So, finally, here's my question.

**Should players who have been waiting for decades to be inducted be made the priority by this committee or should the committee vote the more skilled players in even if it's their first year on new eligibility?**

I'm not saying Dwight Evans and Luis Tiant are more skilled than those 3 players, or that they deserve to be in the Hall of Fame more. I would just rather see guys who've been waiting decades make it in before guys who just had 10 consecutive chances and didn't make it, no matter how much they deserve to be in.

SF Giants fan here. Been going through some really rough times lately and have always always found comfort in baseball. I have notebooks full of notes on every teams history and spent most classes in college writing out the all time lineups of every team. All that to say, I’m asking every teams fan base the same question. 

What makes your team great? 

Is it your favorite player? The history? Your stadium? Your broadcasters? Your retired numbers? 

Basically I’m asking you to gush to me about your love for your team as if you’re recruiting me to your fan base.

I just bought my first ever baseball ticket (I'm from Europe!), for the Red Sox vs Cardinals on the 19th of June 2022 at Fenway Park. I bought it directly from [mlb.com](https://mlb.com), then I installed the MLB Ballpark app on my phone.

My tickets are there, but if I click on them I get a ""Barcode Unavailable \[22\] Barcode will display at a later time"". That feels very weird to me (I am scared as hell, I don't want to be stuck at the entrance that day! Is this a message you guys get too? If so when does the barcode appear?

Side note: to make things more complex, I clumsily forwarded to myself (same account, same mail address) the tickets as I thought that'd send me a copy by mail I could print. I hope I did not break anything.

Grabbing Benny and a bullpen arm or two would take this team a long way in my opinion. His slash line is .329/.390/.425 with an OPS+ of 139!! This is Bennys best season since he left us.

My main question is about safety in the general area, anywhere specific to avoid? I've booked a cancelable hotel in the theater district, which seems to be walking distance to Fenway and downtown. I usually just plan on the games and figure out other stuff to do during the day after I'm there but prefer to walk as much as possible. 

I solo travel and haven't had any trouble walking around any parks yet but it's always nice to have an idea before the trip.

It’s my goal to see the Sox play at all 30 stadiums, this weekend would’ve been my 8th but guess it’s not meant to be. I don’t want to waste the ticket so happy to forward to someone who can go. It’s in section 117.

It arrived today. Of course I put up the flag and started wearing the hat right away. I'm not a fucking poser.

After last night's game against the Braves, I want to set something on fire. Maybe an axe? Is that symbolic enough? Maybe the next thing I see that's vaguely pinstriped... That will make my heart feel better.

1,DennyKalid32,"I made a post last year around this time (probably a bit later) saying how much I was excited about the team. Sadly I cannot say the same yet this year. There are a lot of concerns I have with this team, and I really hope they get addressed.

First off everyone besides our first 3 hitters are not producing. Xander, Devers, and Martinez have been fine enough (Though Devers could be doing a bit better). Dalbec has been absolutely deplorable this season so far and I’m starting to hate how he goes on those weird hot streaks but only late in the year. I think we need to call up Casas soon. Verdugo, Story, and Kike need to figure it out Asap. Story cannot be playing like this especially if Xander rumors are true. Finally Vasquez has been bad but I honestly don’t expect a ton out of him offensively, and Jbj has been terrible with the bat as well.

Our rotation is straight up mid right now and will probably only regress. Obviously Eovaldi has looked great and I expect that to stay. I love Whitlock and Have faith in Houck but honestly believe they should be used as relief for now. Wacha is cool but I doubt he’ll keep it up. Pivetta has been disgraceful, and Rich Hill has been okay, but I have concerns for him. 

Our bullpen is also straight up unreliable, which I hate. Barnes looks washed right after we give him a deal. I get stressed everytime Diekman or Sawamura go on the mound though they’ve had a number of decent outings. Robles also makes me nervous. I have actually liked Straham as a mid relief guy so far, and I’ll have to keep watching the Danish and Shreiber guy but they haven’t seemed too bad.

I honestly don’t know but I think our main issues come down to our offense right now. They rank towards the bottom of the league in most regular and advanced hitting stats which is concerning given we were expected to be among the best. The pitching as a whole has actually been alright, but it seems like a lot of over performing from guys who will regress. And the bullpen has been unreliable when we need them the most. What does everyone else think?",1652290453,False,False,1,A quick rundown of the concerns,1.0,0,2075,384

Do you all remember how Clay Buccholz's hair was always wet? [As in this photo?](https://wp.usatodaysports.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/90/2013/10/clay.gif)

What was going on there? Did he take a shower right before the game and then again between innings? Did he gel it purposefully to make it look like that? Was he just sweating profusely through the back of his hat? These are the questions that keep me up at night. I hope Clay is alright and he has figured out a way to not look like that anymore.",1652279111,False,False,1,Long unanswered question that still bugs me,1.0,0,587,99

Currently, the Sox site says ""Pricing currently not available"" and has none for sale at all. Looking at 3rd party resellers, they're asking 4-5x face value, even for mid-week games in August.

1,JPGotter," Hi.

I am a stadium fanatic. Therefore I am building an app which aims to go beyond common apps (in the future). Focus is the stadium, cross sports and global. Currently it is a ""TripAdvisor for Stadiums"", but I will add functions for ""Facebook for Fans"" soon. In the future I want to have all stadium relevant processes combines in the app. Starting from getting to know where a match day is, prepare and plan you stadium visit including ticketing, merchandising, travel, meeting friends etc. execute your matchday and memorize it.

For the **Fenway Park** we just have 2 reviews, ratings and pics and I love to see more and I guess this is the right group to do so.

Download are here:

1,Sandwich_Crust,"I wanted to make this post because even though these players are off to great, even phenomenal starts you may not have heard of them! I've highlighted a few and broken down each affiliate at the bottom. Hope you all enjoy!

**OF Ryan Fizgerald** 13 Games: .304/.377/**.739/1.116, 5 HR,** 14 RBI, 8 XBH, 5 BB

""Fitzy"" was the darling of spring training, hitting 4 HR in only 20 AB at Big League camp, and has only been more impressive during start of his season at AAA. Currently 2nd in the league with 5 HR, his 1.116 OPS is 6th behind teammates Yolmer Sanchez (5th) and Rob Refsnyder (3rd), and his 15 RBI are good for 5th, trailing league-leading teammate Franchy Cordero at 21. At age 28, he is a late bloomer, but very likely will see a call-up sometime in the coming months if he is added to the 40-man roster.

**INF David Hamilton** 13 Games: .327/.414/.571/.985, 3 HR, 13 RBI, 5 XBH, 8 BB, **10 SB**

Hamilton was one of the two prospects acquired along with Jackie Bradley Jr. in the Renfroe deal with Milwaukee and he has immediately shown of multiple plus tools early on. His calling card being his outstanding speed, he currently has the 2nd most steals in all of minor league baseball with 10. While he probably won't be an elite hitter, if he can continue improving his plate discipline he could develop into a solid everyday player with a high stolen base total. Currently at AA, it wouldn't be outside of the realm of possibly to see a September Call-Up for Hamilton if the Red Sox are hoping for threat on the base paths for an October run. 

**INF Ceddanne Rafaela** 13 Games: .379/.429/.776/**1.205**, **6 HR, 14 RBI,** **11 XBH,** 3 BB, 5 SB

Signed for just $10,000 in 2017, one of the most impressive starts in recent memory belongs to Ceddanne Rafaela. With the nickname ""Raffy"", it sure does sound like he's taken some pointers from his Big League counterpart as he has absolute torched pitchers with a League-Leading 6 HR and 14 RBI. HIS OPS currently ranks 2nd at an incredible 1.205 and he is 7th in the league with 5 SB. Prior to this season he has been viewed as a potential utility player only due to his low hit tool, but at Age 21, this could be a breakout performance as he looks to vault up the prospect charts.

**SS Matthew Lugo** 12 Games: **.415**/.446/.698/**1.144,** 1 HR, 8 RBI, **11 XBH,** 2 BB, 2 SB

The former 2nd Round Pick in 2019 was almost all but forgotten by most Red Sox fans heading into his Age-20 season due to inconsistent play. In 2021, he batted .227 the first 2 months of the season before  hitting .303 the final 3 months. The nephew of Carlos Beltran, Lugo currently leads the league with a .415 batting average as he looks to prove that he was worth the early draft slot. The 6'4"" SS has yet to show much power, but as his body continue to develop he certainly has the frame to have average-to-plus power.

1,potnia_theron,"I last paid attention to the Sox in ~2005 when I was still living at home. My mom was a huge fan, she's the one that got me into baseball. After I moved out I kept up enough to chat with her about it for a couple years but didn't have any friends into baseball, so just sort of lost track of the game. My mom still loved it, but thinking back I think she knew I'd sort of lost interest or didn't have the time so she didn't bring it up much.

She died in 2020, she went from healthy to dead in about three weeks from pancreatic cancer. Thinking about her, i'm sort of just realizing that some of my favorite childhood memories of her are of watching games together -- and not just tracking the score, but like keeping up with all the little cultural stuff, like ARod slapping the ball away, Pedro knocking Zimmer to the ground, etc. She loved to talk about her younger days following the Sox farm teams and how she was one of Pudge Fisk's first fans, cheering for him way back when he was playing AA in Pittsfield.

Anyway, this isn't meant to be a soliloquy, but my kids are a little bit older now (5 and 8) and I just took them to a game last week, which they loved (I'm sure the snacks helped). Their grammy always said she wanted to be the one who took them to 'mecca' for the first time (Fenway), and I really regretted not being able to explain all the little backstories about the players and the team the way she would have. Explaining the basic rules isn't exactly engaging for kids!

So, just wondering if anyone has any suggestions for stuff I can read or like a sort of cultural history of the team over the last few years so I can feel like I actually know the guys out on the field.",1650745548,False,False,1,"I haven't watched the sox/baseball since 2005, and getting back into it is hard without knowing all the player stories and club lore over the last few years.

1,KingShitOfTurdIsland,"With the season starting shortly, I thought it'd be fun to make some crazy predictions based on this teams 2022 season. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Alex Verdugo -** Hits .286 with 78 RBI and a .848 OPS

**Franchy Cordero -** Becomes the greatest hitter in Woosox history, becomes best friends with Rusney Castillo. Plays in 6 games with the Sox sometime in September, gets on base twice. Returns to Worcester in time for a playoff run.

**Rich Hill -** In his 4th stint with the Red Sox struggles a bit down the stretch, 98.5 the Sports Hub is in a fury. Goes on to have a post season like 2013 John Lackey. 

**Kike Hernandez -** Has another fantastic year, wins his first gold glove.

**Rafael Devers -** Makes less than 20 errors at 3rd. Elected to his 2nd All Star Game, signs a massive extension and finishes in top 5 of MVP voting.

**Bobby Dalbec -** Hits 35 HR's, hits .256 and buys a summer home on Lake Winnipesaukee as he becomes the full time first baseman. 

**Hansel Robles  -** Makes the roster out of spring training, beats Barnes out in the closer roll. Points up at a ball he believes is a pop up that actually lands on the Mass Pike 3x's this season. 

&amp;#x200B;

These likely will all be wrong, and it was not based on any factual evidence. I am curious to what you think will happen?",1647820050,False,False,1,"What to early, crazy season predictions!",1.0,0,1297,232

I am JP and I quit my job to build an app for supporters and stadium fanatics - ArenaFans. For my MVP I am looking for volunteer testers giving me feedback to make the app more valuable for the fans. The app wants to be cross sports, global and mobile only. Of course currently it is really soccer focussed - okay, I'am german, but I am also cover all major team sports.

I am reaching out, because I have your home ground (Fenway Park) already in the app but no one rated, commented or uploaded a pic of the stadium yet. Love to see some feedback about your ground. And if you don't mind to feedback me would be great - written or in a zoom e.g. Unfortunately I am missing the photos of my own Fenway experience in 2000 against Kansas City. I didn't had my smartphone with me - haha.

You can find the app in both stores for iOS or Android.

I was just wondering why you get back in the batter’s box after ball four.’ He said, ‘I don’t keep track of the balls.’ He said, ‘I don’t keep track of the strikes, either, until I got two.’ Then he said, ‘Duke, I’m up there looking for a pitch I can hit. If I don’t get it, I wait for the umpire to tell me to go to first. Isn’t that what you’re paying me to do?’ ”

Of course I went and looked up what games this would've happened in so I could see it for myself, but annoyingly, I've found nothing within the timeframe given or even outside of it. , nor in any other walks I found in both earlier games for the Indians and later Red Sox games.

If anyone else knows how to find game footage from 2001 to verify this or not, I would love while company trying to figure out if this story is true or

1,StonkDude9199,"So me and my buddies have been having this discussion a lot lately and I wanted to weigh in here and see what you all think. We’ve been debating the subject of a Red Sox all time lineup a lot and while there are plenty of articles out there about this I like the one I’ve come up with. 

This is coming from a Boston kid born in the 90’s (we all were born 1-2 years apart) and I don’t consider older players (1900-1938) to be that relevant. 

I’m talking guys who can still play today against modern players!!!!!

**Catcher**: Jason Varitek (“Tek”)- Switch hitter with ok offensive stats. Ya, Fisk might have been better at the plate but this guy called the best game behind the plate in history. Tied for the MLB record of caught no-no’s (4) and could handle any pitcher (minus Wake) with ease.

**1B**: Mo Vaughn- Guy was a beast in 90’s. One could argue Jimmie Foxx here but I don’t think he could compete with modern pitching. Mo would love to see a 101 MPH fastball and deposit it into the bullpen.

**2B**: Dustin Pedroia (“Pedey”)-not even sure I need to list his accomplishments. The Laser Show speaks for himself with his career accomplishments.

**SS**: Nomar Garciaparra- This one I’ve gotten a lot of shit for because he was always my favorite player growing up. Guy hit .323 in 9 years with the Sox though, that’s pretty damn impressive.

**3B**: Wade Boggs- Kind of a no-brainer. Hall of Famer, stud athlete, 3,000 hit club. Not much to go against him. For nostalgia sake we like to argue Mike Lowell could be up there but he isn’t on the same level as Boggs.

**LF**: Ted Williams (“Teddy Ballgame”)- Pretty self-explanatory. Me and my buddies set the years because you have to include Teddy Ballgame. 

**CF**: Mookie Betts- Maybe it’s the bias in me but playing him in center with the corner outfielders would be the best OF of all time.

**RF**: Dwight Evans- Pretty damn strong offensive stats (.272 avg, 385 bombs) and was known to have a cannon of an arm. Besides Mookie we never have had someone else to put here. 

**DH**: David Ortiz (“Big Papi”)- any other person in the DH slot would just be wrong. I know it, you know it, there is no argument here.

This is my ideal Sox Batting Lineup, share your thoughts and suggestions!! Honestly would love to be convinced of a change, it’s a boring day at work hahaha",1645729190,False,False,1,RED SOX All Time Batting Lineup (1939-Present),1.0,31,2333,415

Complaining that a reason Ortiz got in was his likability is such a compliment but those fucking idiots think it’s some sort of dagger.

Theory 1: Using the character clause to keep suspected and even known steroid users out of the HOF, who would otherwise likely be elected, is absolutely bogus. But if the BBWAA are going to stick with it, then they should expunge from the Hall any journalists who made their names (and money) during the ""steroid era.""

Theory 2: As a result of players being kept out of the hall but left on the ballot, a resulting backlog has caused players that came later but who are deserving of consideration get left out altogether.

1,idsoxfan,"It is my completely biased opinion that Jonathan Papelbon is the best closer the Red Sox have ever had on their roster.

These are arguably the 5 best closers in Red Sox history, if there's something you think I should've included, let me know and I'll add them to the list. Anyway, I took all their stats from their time with the Sox. Except for Pap's '05 because he wasn't rookie eligible. Also an important note is any WAR that's referenced is Pitching WAR from Baseball Reference.

Dick Radatz (1962-1965): 538.1 IP, 2.57 ERA, 1.111 WHIP, 2.55 FIP, 151 ERA+, 49-32 (.605%), 98 SV

Bob Stanley (1977-1989): 1707.0 IP, 3.64, 1.364 WHIP, 3.68 FIP, 118 ERA+, 115-97 (.542%), 132 SV

Keith Foulke (2004-2006): 178.1 IP, 3.73 ERA, 1.116 WHIP, 4.11 FIP, 127 ERA+, 13-9 (.591%), 47 SV

Jonathan Papelbon (2006-2011): 395.1 IP, 2.30 ERA, 0.979 WHIP, 2.45 FIP, 199 ERA+, 20-18 (.526%), 219 SV

Koji Uehara (2013-2016): 226.0 IP, 2.19 ERA, 0.810 WHIP, 2.57 FIP, 192 ERA+, 14-13 (.519%), 79 SV

Very clearly, there are only two options, Pap and Koji. Radatz isn't far off but these 2 were just too amazing.

Their stat lines are eerily similar, with Koji taking the slight advantage in ERA and WHIP, and Pap edging him out in FIP and ERA+. Pap takes another victory with average WAR per year at 2.5 compared to Koji's 1.8. Their batting against stat lines are as follows. Pap: .199/.255/.300/.556 vs. Koji: .181/.219/.332/.551. Koji was better a limiting traffic, Pap was better at limiting hard contact. This is shown by Pap's 1.9% HR% vs 3.0% and 36.5% GB% vs. 31.2%, and Koji's 4.3% BB% vs 6.2% and .243 BAbip vs. .274.

Let's move on to their best seasons with the Sox: Pap's 2006 vs Koji's 2013.

Papelbon/Koji
WAR: 5.0/3.5
IP: 68.1/74.1
ERA: 0.92/1.09
WHIP: 0.776/0.565
FIP: 2.14/1.61
ERA+: 517/379
SV: 35-41 (.854%)/21-24 (.875%)

Both amazing seasons, but Papelbon's was inherently more valuable according to WAR and ERA+. I also feel like it's important to note that he put up these numbers after only 17 appearances in 2005. He actually put up a better WAR than the guy who beat him out for ROY. Justin Verlander.

As for postseason careers, both were instrumental in their squads' respective World Series titles. In 2007, Pap made 7 appearances with 10.2 IP, 1-0 with 4 SV, a 0.00 ERA, 0.844 WHIP, and made one of the most iconic Boston sports pictures after he struck out Seth Smith. Koji made 13 appearances in 2013, totalling 13.2 IP, 1-1 with 7 SV, a 0.66 ERA, .512 WHIP, won ALCS MVP and clinched our first WS at Fenway since 1918. 

For his overall postseason career, Pap went scoreless in 17 of his 18 appearances for a 1.00 ERA in 27.0 IP. Going 2-1 with 7 SV and a 0.815 WHIP. Koji made 15 total appearances in the playoffs, allowing only 1 run in 15.2 IP for a 0.57 ERA while going 1-1 with 7 SV and a 0.511 WHIP.

Personally, Papelbon's X-factor was his consistency in his effectiveness during his tenure. Even in his worst season, with a 1.269 WHIP and 3.90 ERA, he still had 37 saves, a 112 ERA+, and put up a 3.51 FIP.

I'm in the camp that Papelbon should be inducted into the HOF. The whole ""1st ballot vs 10th ballot"" is stupid to me, you're either a Hall of Famer or you're not, you got inducted or you didn't. But to appease that crowd, I would like to see him get in on his 4th or 5th year. He was the best closer in baseball from 2006-2009. Mariano is (obviously) the only one who gives him competition. He's 10th in all-time saves having only pitched 12 seasons, as well as having a .882% SV%. More saves than Rollie Fingers (17) and Bruce Sutter (12) who are both HOFers. He also only has 11 less saves than Joe Nathan who pitched in 4 more seasons. He sports a career 2.44 ERA, 1.043 WHIP, 2.82 FIP, 177 ERA+, and 23.3 WAR. Sutter has 24.5 and Fingers has 25.0.

1,idsoxfan,"It is my completely biased opinion that Jonathan Papelbon is the best closer the Red Sox have ever had on their roster.

These are arguably the 5 best closers in Red Sox history, if there's something you think I should've included, let me know and I'll add them to the list. Anyway, I took all their stats from their time with the Sox. Except for Pap's '05 because he wasn't rookie eligible. Also an important note is any WAR that's referenced is Pitching WAR from Baseball Reference.

Dick Radatz (1962-1965): 538.1 IP, 2.57 ERA, 1.111 WHIP, 2.55 FIP, 151 ERA+, 49-32 (.605%), 98 SV

Bob Stanley (1977-1989): 1707.0 IP, 3.64, 1.364 WHIP, 3.68 FIP, 118 ERA+, 115-97 (.542%), 132 SV

Keith Foulke (2004-2006): 178.1 IP, 3.73 ERA, 1.116 WHIP, 4.11 FIP, 127 ERA+, 13-9 (.591%), 47 SV

Jonathan Papelbon (2006-2011): 395.1 IP, 2.30 ERA, 0.979 WHIP, 2.45 FIP, 199 ERA+, 20-18 (.526%), 219 SV

Very clearly, there are only two options, Pap and Koji. Radatz isn't far off but these 2 were just too amazing.

Their stat lines are eerily similar, with Koji taking the slight advantage in ERA and WHIP, and Pap edging him out in FIP and ERA+. Pap takes another victory with average WAR per year at 2.5 compared to Koji's 1.8. Their batting against stat lines are as follows. Pap: .199/.255/.300/.556 vs. Koji: .181/.219/.332/.551. Koji was better a limiting traffic, Pap was better at limiting hard contact. This is shown by Pap's 1.9% HR% vs 3.0% and 36.5% GB% vs. 31.2%, and Koji's 4.3% BB% vs 6.2% and .243 BAbip vs. .274.

Let's move on to their best seasons with the Sox: Pap's 2006 vs Koji's 2013.

Papelbon/Koji
WAR: 5.0/3.5

There is no rhyme or reason to these rankings other than a subjective feeling of if I think the player was good enough, had a strong/noteworthy career, ever played a single game for the Red Sox, and seems just a bit ridiculous that they should be actually considered a Red Sox.

1,New-Square3037,"So, just my brief thoughts.
Without trades, we could sign Eddy on an incentive laden contract for 2-3 years @$8-$10 mil
Take a flyer on Lester for a deal @ $2mil/yr, maybe have him retire a Sox… and let the young kids find their form. Be a mentor. He still eats innings.

That’s @ $10 mil. We have $25 mil still under cap, even if we do all of our arb-eligible guys near max.

Grab Belt for 1st base, on a 2-3 year @ $12-15mil/year, still leaves $7-9 mil to put Schwarber in left, and maybe move Iglesias on board @ $2mil/yr.

Next year, $16 mil drops off payroll for Price’s dog Astro which will leave room for Dever’s extension, and to grab a decent catcher and/or decide on a small bridge contract for Vazquez. Still tons of depth all around the infield and solid bats and decent defense in the outfield.

It would keep us under cap, or close

I would dip my balls in flaming hot wax and do a cannonball into a volcano if it meant I never had to watch these 3 play in a Red Sox jersey ever again. Danny Santana is genuinely the worst player i’ve ever seen play at the big league level. I’m not joking. How he is so impossibly bad at everything in baseball is completely beyond me I don’t think he had one positive contribution all year. He’s like the result you get when you do the exact opposite of making your video game create a player really good. If Danny Santana is employed by a major league team next year i’m 1000% assuming he has dirt on Rob Man fred. 

Travis Shaw the mayor of strikeout city is just awful. I mean just awful. He hit one grand slam this year and other then that we were lucky if he even hit a foul ball. All he had to do was stick his bat out there and make contact and he couldn’t even do that. There’s no way we couldn’t have found anyone else on the planet to be a horrible lefty pinch hitter in any scenario he was placed in at all. I guarantee Big Papi still in his suit and tie could walk out of the Fox booth and at least make it look like he understood that his team needed a hit when he got called on to do his only job.

Martin Perez is the kind of pitcher who every time he lets go of the ball he makes atheists pray to God. When he came in to pitch the question wasn’t how he was gonna do, it was if the other team would be able to hit the middle middle pitch out of the park. I watched him pitch in relief this year and every one of his 6 outs was hit to the warning track. If he ever pitches again in a red sox uniform i’m gonna have to seek therapy. How you can be so bad at your job and continue to be put in games like that is unreal. You’d think if you were a pro pitcher you’d learn to miss the middle of the plate eventually but apparently not.

by A. Bartlett Giamatti, et al

""The Green Fields of the Mind ""
It breaks your heart. It is designed to break your heart. The game begins in the spring, when everything else begins again, and it blossoms in the summer, filling the afternoons and evenings, and then as soon as the chill rains come, it stops and leaves you to face the fall alone. You count on it, rely on it to buffer the passage of time, to keep the memory of sunshine and high skies alive, and then just when the days are all twilight, when you need it most, it stops. Today, October 2, a Sunday of rain and broken branches and leaf-clogged drains and slick streets, it stopped, and summer was gone.

Somehow, the summer seemed to slip by faster this time. Maybe it wasn't this summer, but all the summers that, in this my fortieth summer, slipped by so fast. There comes a time when every summer will have something of autumn about it. Whatever the reason, it seemed to me that I was investing more and more in baseball, making the game do more of the work that keeps time fat and slow and lazy. I was counting on the game's deep patterns, three strikes, three outs, three times three innings, and its deepest impulse, to go out and back, to leave and to return home, to set the order of the day and to organize the daylight. I wrote a few things this last summer, this summer that did not last, nothing grand but some things, and yet that work was just camouflage. The real activity was done with the radio--not the all-seeing, all-falsifying television--and was the playing of the game in the only place it will last, the enclosed green field of the mind. There, in that warm, bright place, what the old poet called Mutability does not so quickly come.

But out here, on Sunday, October 2, where it rains all day, Dame Mutability never loses. She was in the crowd at Fenway yesterday, a gray day full of bluster and contradiction, when the Red Sox came up in the last of the ninth trailing Baltimore 8-5, while the Yankees, rain-delayed against Detroit, only needing to win one or have Boston lose one to win it all, sat in New York washing down cold cuts with beer and watching the Boston game. Boston had won two, the Yankees had lost two, and suddenly it seemed as if the whole season might go to the last day, or beyond, except here was Boston losing 8-5, while New York sat in its family room and put its feet up. Lynn, both ankles hurting now as they had in July, hits a single down the right-field line. The crowd stirs. It is on its feet. Hobson, third baseman, former Bear Bryant quarterback, strong, quiet, over 100 RBIs, goes for three breaking balls and is out. The goddess smiles and encourages her agent, a canny journeyman named Nelson Briles.

Now comes a pinch hitter, Bernie Carbo, onetime Rookie of the Year, erratic, quick, a shade too handsome, so laid-back he is always, in his soul, stretched out in the tall grass, one arm under his head, watching the clouds and laughing; now he looks over some low stuff unworthy of him and then, uncoiling, sends one out, straight on a rising line, over the center-field wall, no cheap Fenway shot, but all of it, the physics as elegant as the arc the ball describes.

New England is on its feet, roaring. The summer will not pass. Roaring, they recall the evening, late and cold, in 1975, the sixth game of the World Series, perhaps the greatest baseball game played in the last fifty years, when Carbo, loose and easy, had uncoiled to tie the game that Fisk would win. It is 8-7, one out, and school will never start, rain will never come, sun will warm the back of your neck forever. Now Bailey, picked up from the National League recently, big arms, heavy gut, experienced, new to the league and the club; he fouls off two and then, checking, tentative, a big man off balance, he pops a soft liner to the first baseman. It is suddenly darker and later, and the announcer doing the game coast to coast, a New Yorker who works for a New York television station, sounds relieved. His little world, well-lit, hot-combed, split-second-timed, had no capacity to absorb this much gritty, grainy, contrary reality.

Cox swings a bat, stretches his long arms, bends his back, the rookie from Pawtucket who broke in two weeks earlier with a record six straight hits, the kid drafted ahead of Fred Lynn, rangy, smooth, cool. The count runs two and two, Briles is cagey, nothing too good, and Cox swings, the ball beginning toward the mound and then, in a jaunty, wayward dance, skipping past Briles, feinting to the right, skimming the last of the grass, finding the dirt, moving now like some small, purposeful marine creature negotiating the green deep, easily avoiding the jagged rock of second base, traveling steady and straight now out into the dark, silent recesses of center field.

The aisles are jammed, the place is on its feet, the wrappers, the programs, the Coke cups and peanut shells, the doctrines of an afternoon; the anxieties, the things that have to be done tomorrow, the regrets about yesterday, the accumulation of a summer: all forgotten, while hope, the anchor, bites and takes hold where a moment before it seemed we would be swept out with the tide. Rice is up. Rice whom Aaron had said was the only one he'd seen with the ability to break his records. Rice the best clutch hitter on the club, with the best slugging percentage in the league. Rice, so quick and strong he once checked his swing halfway through and snapped the bat in two. Rice the Hammer of God sent to scourge the Yankees, the sound was overwhelming, fathers pounded their sons on the back, cars pulled off the road, households froze, New England exulted in its blessedness, and roared its thanks for all good things, for Rice and for a summer stretching halfway through October. Briles threw, Rice swung, and it was over. One pitch, a fly to center, and it stopped. Summer died in New England and like rain sliding off a roof, the crowd slipped out of Fenway, quickly, with only a steady murmur of concern for the drive ahead remaining of the roar. Mutability had turned the seasons and translated hope to memory once again. And, once again, she had used baseball, our best invention to stay change, to bring change on.

That is why it breaks my heart, that game--not because in New York they could win because Boston lost; in that, there is a rough justice, and a reminder to the Yankees of how slight and fragile are the circumstances that exalt one group of human beings over another. It breaks my heart because it was meant to, because it was meant to foster in me again the illusion that there was something abiding, some pattern and some impulse that could come together to make a reality that would resist the corrosion; and because, after it had fostered again that most hungered-for illusion, the game was meant to stop, and betray precisely what it promised.

Of course, there are those who learn after the first few times. They grow out of sports. And there are others who were born with the wisdom to know that nothing lasts. These are the truly tough among us, the ones who can live without illusion, or without even the hope of illusion. I am not that grown-up or up-to-date. I am a simpler creature, tied to more primitive patterns and cycles. I need to think something lasts forever, and it might as well be that state of being that is a game; it might as well be that, in a green field, in the sun.",1634993955,False,False,1,The Green Fields of the Mind,1.0,8,7509,1347
1,AmpullaOfWater,"This team beat expectations. It was a fun ride throughout the season. 

But I have a bad taste in my mouth after this series. This series was there for the taking. People say the Astros are the better team but we played much better than they did for a majority of the season. 

We blew game 1. Put us in a hole. 
Then go up 2-1 and blow game 4. Will forever be known as the Laz Diaz game. But then we put in Martin Perez and gave up. Bottom 9 is a completely different story if you’re down 1. 

Then games 5 and 6 the offense magically disappeared against average pitchers. 

Key moments that didn’t go our way: 
-Kikè dropped the ball to go down 1-0 in game 6 was brutal. We would have had a tie game much longer and you don’t know what happens. 
-Correa’s double in the 9th to Renfroe should have been caught. I know mookie catches that. 
-Kikè and Schwarber hitting bombs to left field that didn’t go for a homerun but then Kyle tucker places a perfect ball into the stands to end the season 
-Renfroes shot down the line in game 4 that Bergman makes a play on to save multiple runs. 

I said once we beat the Yankees that this was a successful season no matter what but it’s a tough pill to swallow knowing that this team could easily be heading to the World Series.",1634992269,False,False,1,Unpopular Opinion,1.0,13,1270,245
1,wardensarecool,"Not that our season has come to an end, one I hoped we had a total of six more wins left to have but oh well.  I'm sure there are going to be a ton of ""Off season wish lists"" and what not, so why not get the ball rolling.

First thing first I think we need one more High middle to top tier starter.  In a dream world I would like to try and get  Max Scherzer, but he's 37 and is going to want a massive pay day which I don't see this team doing.  So I think either  Carlos Rodón (age 29) or  Robbie Ray (age 30).  Try to get one or the other for about 4 years 60m.  I wouldn't also mind grabbing Yusei Kikuchi, he's around the same age didn't have the best of season with seattle but I think he could be a really good fit.

Bull Pen:  We need an every day closer, and I think we already have him on the roster.  But other than that one or two more solid arms would be great and needed.

Catching: I think we are good here, so we need to pick up  Vázquez's option and sign him for another couple of years.

First base: I like  Schwarber, he made some great leaps and bounds defensively and given a full off season of work at first base he could be really good.  My dream though would be Sign Freddie Freeman.  His defense is second to none, he can come up big with the hits and as a left hander I see him upping his home run totals with wrapping pitches around the Pesky pole.

Second Base:  Hernandez, should be resigned and moved from center (though he's really damn good there) and back to second base to open up an outfielder spot.  Or we keep Hernandez in Center and sign  Marcus Semien.  Big bat another threat in the line up to take some pressure off Martinez Xander and Devers.

SS, LF 3rd and RF: We are all set there with Xander, Devers, Verdugo and Renfore we are all good.  
note:  if Nolan opts out of his deal with St. Louis, I love Devers but I would be all in to grab him up off the market.  I think he would be a beast in Fenway.

CF:  I would like to se a true leader off hitter here.  I'd love to sign Starling Marte but he's 33 and going to want a lot of money at this point.

Those are my thoughts.  I really only went with free agents as I think we should hold onto our farm pieces.",1634991570,False,False,1,Off Season hopes,1.0,17,2203,458

No, I'm not surprised by an 0-3 start, but hear me out...

In a lot of pre-season projections, the Red Sox were consistently projected to reach 80-83 wins. USA Today pegged them at 80-82, CBS Sports had them at 79.5 (round to 80 for the sake of argument), and PECOTA estimated 79.8 (again, round to 80) wins.

I just don't see our hated rivals hovering around .500 at all this season. Verdugo, Martinez, Bogaerts and Devers do create a formidable heart of the order, but who else in their lineup can hit? Kike Hernandez is the only other notable name in their lineup, and he has a career .735 OPS.

I don't need to go into detail about the rotation, especially since Sale could be out until any point between May and August. Eduardo Rodriguez is a slightly above average pitcher when healthy, but that's about it.

The bullpen? Matt Barnes isn't that good, and Ottaviano cannot flourish in high-leverage situations or tight games. The rest of their bullpen is makeshift.

Maybe I'll end up being wrong, but I fail to see how the Red Sox will be anywhere near .500 this season.",1634967317,True,False,1,Some comfort food: the pasta primavera we've all come to love this year still tastes great after tonight. Maybe even better.,1.0,2,1191,209
1,Th4_Sup3rce11,"2020 we were bottom of the AL. Coming into this season even with Cora back at the helm there was still a lot of uncertainty, especially with the starting rotation. We opened the season getting swept by the O’s. If you had told me that first week we would be in an ALCS game 6 I would have laughed at you. But then we took off, leading the AL for much of the first half of the season.We didn’t go out and grab any huge names at the deadline; just Kyle Schwarber who was injured at the time. We slumped hard after the all star break, letting the Yankmees catch back up and pass us in the division. I’m pretty sure Toronto overtook us at one point. But when the end of the season came around and the games mattered, we performed. Schwarber returned and was an amazing addition to the lineup. Kike got hot. Renfroe made big plays. The pitching stepped up again. And we knocked the damn division out of the postseason and made a deep run against the asterisks in the ALCS, taking them to game 6. It sucks that it ends here. It sucks that Houston has moved on. But this team will be back even stronger next yea, and i trust what Chaim Bloom has in the works.

1,Robinho999,"Since we have a few days off I thought it would be fun to hear people’s favorite games they saw live at Fenway. 

The “biggest” game I’ve ever seen live at Fenway was game 7 of the ALCS in 2007. It was a nailbiter for most of the game until we blew it open at the end - I turned to my buddy in the 7th and called the Pedroia HR put us up by 3 before they dumped it on in the 8th.

But, my FAVORITE but more obscure game I saw live was July 31st, 2005. It was an afternoon game on trade deadline day against the Twins. The team was kind of mediocre in 2005 coming off of the 04 championship and like MANY trade deadlines in this era, Manny Ramirez was hot in the headlines for the day. Also, Jonathon Papelbon made his MLB debut as a STARTER and pitched 5 1/3 striking out 7. 

Manny didn’t even start because the rumors were going around that he was going to be dealt to the Mets for….Cliff Floyd (or Mike Cameron depending on which article you read) and Lastings Milledge…I shit you not this is something that very nearly happened, when we arrived at the ballpark it was a very very real possibility that he was going to be gone before the game was over.

Now, you have to remember, in 2005 it wasn’t that common for people to have internet on their phones so we were all just sitting at the ballpark wondering if Manny was going to be dealt while we were at the game. So even when 4PM passed it’s not like we really knew whether the deal went through or not. 

Fast forward to 4:45, 2 outs, bottom of the 8th, it’s tied 3-3. Juan Rincon is on the mound, Edgar Renteria doubles, Ortiz gets the intentional walk…and who steps into the on-deck circle to hit for Adam Stern? MANNY FUCKING RAMIREZ. The whole ballpark erupted. It was the first idea any of us had that he wasn’t traded at the deadline. 5th pitch of the at-bat he hits a single up the middle and Renteria scores to put us up 4-3. The place went fucking nuts. 

Another weird part of this game was Curt Schilling came in to get the save in the 9th as he rehabbed his ankle from the 04 championship run.

Such a random ass game that probably no one remembers and was insignificant in the grand scheme of things but the drama of the trade deadline made it really memorable.",1634174183,True,False,1,Favorite games you’ve seen at Fenway?,1.0,58,2232,429

1,Its_Doobs,"Hello all,

I just wanted to chat a bit about this Redsox team and how I am coping with the last two games and keeping my hopes and dreams alive.

The first thing I want to say is that this team is overachieving beyond all of our expectations and that should be the baseline of what our hopes are built on.

Secondly, it is a bummer that we lost the first two games of this series but even so if we win tonight we still hold the outright lead for the first wild card spot which puts us in excellent position to hold onto it.

Thirdly, I will root for this team and hope that somehow someway they can win their way into a world series championship but the reality is our bullpen depth is lacking, all of our starters have issues, and our lineup is not deep but very front loaded. Things that will all hopefully be fixed in the upcoming offseason but as of right now we have a lot of flaws that we have been able to hide for most of the season.

Lastly, the reality is that this team has a low chance to win the world series and most likely won't sniff it THIS YEAR. Put yourself in the shoes of the Athletics or Mariners, while they have had good seasons the reality is that if they make the postseason they will probably not sniff the world series except we have the opportunity to know that next season will be even better than this season and we should be prime contenders next season those teams don't have that. Like I said before, I will root for this team like crazy and I hope we pull off the improbable but it is important to realize that this team probably shouldn't have done this well and that's awesome regardless!",1632661566,False,False,1,Expectations,1.0,8,1626,307

1,jkphelps,"I know this is a highly debated topic, but I have a new idea. 
Schwarber needs to be in the line up, but he can't play first. Bobby has first on lock both because he's a better defender and because he's so hot. The red Sox need to decide if kike is going to play second or center. In an ideal world he plays center, but we don't have a second baseman I feel confident in, and 4 other outfielders who need to be in the lineup. I think Renfroe can play center at Fenway. He has the arm to get the ball in and he plays hard line drives better than Verdugo. The bottom line is, Arroyo will not be ready for the playoffs, and kike playing second gives us the best line up. I just can't imagine sitting any of these guys for someone who hasn't gotten a hit in two months. 
So the way I'd arrange it now is
1. Kike 2B
2. Schwarber LF
3. Xander SS
4. Devers 3B
5. J.D. DH
6. Verdugo RF
7. Renfroe CF
